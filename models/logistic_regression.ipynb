      " New research suggests that one of the more popular antidepressants, Paxil, may actually contribute to the growth of cancerous tumors in women. That's according to a team of scientists from the City of Hope in Duarte, California, which has developed a quick way to zero in on drugs and chemicals that are capable of disrupting human sex hormones and influencing the development and progression of diseases, like breast cancer in women. As reported by the Los Angeles Times : In a trial screening of 446 drugs in wide circulation, the new assay singled out the popular antidepressant paroxetine (better known by its commercial name, Paxil) as having a weak estrogenic effect that could promote the development and growth of breast tumors in women. The finding is important because as much as 25 percent of women who are under treatment for breast cancer suffer from depression, and that's a condition regularly treated with antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, like Paxil (which has been on the market for 22 years). Furthermore, the study showed, nearly a quarter of all women in the U.S. in their 40s and 50s are on some form of antidepressant, mostly SSRIs. Other medications also have a similar negative effect on estrogen The Times reported that, last summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of a low-dose paroxetine, which has been repackaged under the trade name Brisdelle, as a treatment for hot flashes and other menopause-related problems that is also non-hormonal. Some 70 percent of breast cancers in women are estrogen-sensitive, which means that a hormone found in abundance in childbearing-aged females actually contributes to the growth of cancerous tumors. The unique screening method that was developed at City of Hope, which was detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Toxicological Sciences , also identified a pair of antifungal drugs -- biconazole and oxyconazole -- as having a negative effect on estrogen that was similar to that of medications prescribed to prevent breast cancer and stop it from recurring in women. More from the Times : Incidental to their intended use in combating fungal infections, those medications inhibit the action of aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgens -- hormones more plentiful in males but present in both sexes -- into estrogen. Less surprising, the high-throughput screening mechanism identified bisphenol A -- a compound used in the manufacture of plastics and epoxy resins -- as an estrogen promoter capable of raising breast cancer risk. The finding that Paxil has an endocrine-altering effect may provide insight to cancer researchers regarding their increased suspicions of medication in women with breast cancer. In 2010, for example, a study found that breast cancer patients in Canada who were prescribed Paxil were more likely than those who had been given a different antidepressant to die of breast cancer, 'when there was a substantial overlap in their use of that antidepressant and of tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer recurrence,' the Times reported. The researchers believed that paroxetine -- taken by about one-fourth of cancer patients in the study who had been diagnosed with depression -- might block the production of a liver enzyme that scientists say is necessary to break down tamoxifen. The authors of this latest study said that paroxetine's 'weak estrogenic' effect 'may be responsible, in part, for the observed reduction' in tamoxifen's effectiveness in the study. As a class of drugs, SSRIs have proven to be quite controversial, as we have documented for years here at selfnews . Among the most controversial: -- SSRIs have been linked to birth defects, complications during pregnancy and even miscarriages. 'Big Pharma wants pregnant women to take prescription drugs, vaccine shots and even chemotherapy. It's the latest insanity from an industry that kills more Americans ever year than died in the entire Vietnam War. And the latest science reveals that antidepressant use during pregnancy is causing babies to be born with physical defects -- or sometimes not born at all because they're miscarried' [ http://www.selfnews.com ]. -- Studies have shown that women who take SSRIs during pregnancy run a higher risk of developing pulmonary persistent hypertension (high blood pressure) [ http://www.selfnews.com ]. -- And there is this: Studies suggest that SSRIs -- which are prescribed ostensibly to 'treat' depression -- may lead to more suicides among patients taking them [ http://www.selfnews.com ].

      " A new study shows that biofuels which are manufactured from leftover materials of harvested corn are worse than gasoline in causing harmful atmospheric emissions in the short term, a finding that challenges the government's assertions that they are a much cleaner alternative to help combat climate change. According to E&E; Publishing, using corn cobs and stover to manufacture cellulose biofuels actually increases emissions from the plant matter and other residue components being burned at biorefineries around the country, rather than being mixed into the soil and remaining trapped as organic soil matter, said researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 'If the residue had not been removed, some of it would be left in the field and be naturally added to maintain soil carbon,' said Adam Liska, lead author of the paper and assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the University of Nebraska. The Associated Press further noted: A $500,000 study paid for by the federal government and released [ April 20 ] in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change concludes that biofuels made with corn residue release 7 percent more greenhouse gases in the early years compared with conventional gasoline. While biofuels are better in the long run, the study says they won't meet a standard set in a 2007 energy law to qualify as renewable fuel. Wisconsin, Minnesota carry more carbon losses' Reports said that researchers used a computer model to estimate emissions across the nation's so-called Corn Belt, which consists of about 128 million acres (or about 96.8 million football fields). A removal rate of about 2.68 metric tons per acre per year over five to 10 years may decrease soil organic carbon by some 200 pounds per acre per year. 'This can add an average of 50 to 70 grams of CO2 per megajoule of biofuel. At the high end, this makes these biofuels emit about 7 percent more carbon dioxide than gasoline, making them slightly worse from a climate perspective. Over 10 years, it would reduce gasoline emissions by about 15 percent,' E&E; reported. Researchers said that Wisconsin and Minnesota were found to carry higher carbon losses. They estimate that the cold weather in these states may slow the release of soil organic carbon into the atmosphere. Liska says that the higher corn yields in these states can add larger amounts of carbon to the soil, which then represents a larger loss if corn residue is collected. The AP reported that the study's findings are bad news for what are known as cellulosic biofuels, which have received more than $1 billion in federal subsidies and support but have nevertheless struggled to meet volume targets mandated by law. Some 50 percent of the initial market in cellulosics is estimated to be derived from corn residue. Biofuel industry officials, as well as those within the Obama administration, immediately rebuked the findings and said the research was flawed. Douglas Karlen, a research leader in the Agriculture Department's Agricultural Research Service, said, for example, that the study was too simplistic in its analysis of the loss of carbon from soil, which he says can vary from field to field. Researchers also vastly overestimated how much residue farmers actually remove once the market is up and running. 'I knew this research would be contentious' And, adds Jan Koninckx, the global business director for biorefineries at DuPont: 'The core analysis depicts an extreme scenario that no responsible farmer or business would ever employ because it would ruin both the land and the long-term supply of feedstock. It makes no agronomic or business sense.' Later in the year, DuPont is scheduled to complete construction on a facility estimated to cost in excess of $200 million in Nevada, Iowa, that is expected to produce some 30 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol using corn residue from local farms. A DuPont-financed assessment said the ethanol it will make at the facility could be 100 percent better than gasoline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. 'I knew this research would be contentious,' said Liska. 'I'm amazed it has not come out more solidly until now.' One other aspect of using ethanol-laced fuel instead of 100 percent fossil fuel: The ethanol-laced fuel gets worse mileage per gallon, so more of it must be produced and burned to go the same number of miles.

      " As controversial as it may sound, botox has now been approved for the treatment of migraines by no less than the US' Food and Drug Administration and the Medicines and Health Care products Regulatory agency of the UK. In a study featured in the journal Cephalalgia , it was discovered that those who availed of botox as a treatment for migraines enjoyed a ten percent reduction in the number of headache days when compared with the placebo group. This finding does not appear to have convinced experts on the efficacy of such procedure. Jen Olesen, Chief of the Danish Headache Centre , Glostrup University Hospital in Denmark, criticizes the findings and identified faults in the trial. He has expressed his concerns to the Lancet which was contained in an editorial of the journal Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin . Olesen is of the opinion that the FDA made a mistake in approving the botox treatment for migraine. According to him, half of the trial participants overused pain medications, preventing the researchers from telling whether the participants had chronic migraine or headache caused by medication overuse. Moreover, it's impossible to hide participants receiving botox treatments, invalidating the double blind nature of the experiment, as their facial expression change. Can Botox genuinely do the job? Botox is a popular drug used for anti-aging treatments. How it came to be considered as a remedy for migraine started ten years ago when some plastic surgeons from Hollywood noticed that their patients felt some relief from migraines after undergoing botox treatment. The idea spread and became an 'off-label-treatment' to other practitioners. The pharmaceutical company that developed botox soon found out and started marketing it as a remedy for migraine. The company was subsequently fined for $375 million for unlawful marketing since at that time, there was no proof that botox could indeed treat migraines . Nevertheless, it appears that some studies are beginning to crop up supporting botox as a possible treatment for migraines. According to a recent article featured in the Journal of the American Medical Association , a review and analysis of previous studies on botox injections as a remedy for migraine only reveals a 'small to modest benefit for patients suffering chronic migraine headaches and chronic daily headaches.' Headache vs. migraine? Migraines and tension type headaches are common, and at some point in their life, at least 42 percent of adults experience a tension type headache. Most, however, do not seek professional help, just preferring to take an aspirin and hope that it goes away. Less common, migraines are associated with greater disability affecting around 8 to 18 percent of people worldwide. A headache normally starts with a feeling of gradual pressure or tightness in the head and then increases into a feeling of a tremendous amount of pressure. A common feature of headaches is that they is felt on both sides of the head.Migraines, on the other hand, are normally felt on one side of the head. Fatigue or lack of sleep, emotional stress and depression have all been identified to be leading causes of headaches. Certain foods have also been identified to have a potentially contributing factor. Dealing with the headache For many people, the onset of a headache means downing a pill. Contrary to popular belief, however, the answer is not always drugs: Drugs only build up dependency and do not in any way address the real source of the matter. Below are some options to dealing with those pesky headaches: Visit a chiropractor - In a study published in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics , 218 study subjects suffering from headache who were given either chiropractic care or drug therapy or both experienced a 40 to 50 percent reduction in pain. However, four weeks after all care ended, those who had chiropractic care still enjoyed the benefit of their relief as opposed to those who received drug therapy who experienced only a 50 percent reduction in their improvement. In a study conducted by Duke University comparing drug therapy using amitriptyline with that of chiropractic care, both treatments had similar short term effects on tension headache pain. Amitriptyline, however, caused adverse reactions in 82 percent of the study subjects. The best part of this study occurred when all care was discontinued, patients who had received drug therapy returned to the state they had prior to the research study, but those who received chiropractic care continued to benefit from reduction in headache frequency and severity. Acupuncture - This is an ancient Chinese healing method that stimulates specific points in the body using thin metallic needles. The British Journal of Medicine published a study which involved 400 adult subjects who experienced regular headaches or migraines. They were divided into groups: one received only standard conventional care while the other group received 12 acupuncture sessions for a three month period. At the conclusion of the said study, it was revealed that compared to those who were on conventional care, participants who received acupuncture sessions experienced more or less fewer overall headaches and used less medication. This group also reported taking only a few sick days off from work. Try herbal remedies - History has shown how herbs have been used for food and medicine. Using herbs instead of downing a common prescription drug for pain has its advantages since herbs do not normally have the unwanted side effects of prescription drugs. Moreover, their continued use over the centuries has proven its safety for human consumption. Nevertheless, even though herbs have no or little undesirable side effects, they can cause some undesirable reactions in some persons. It is recommended, therefore, to try one herb at a time beginning with small doses and watching out for side effects. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, ginger is highly recommended for dealing with headaches: you can either eat it fresh or enjoy it as tea. You can also enjoy herbal teas like chamomile, peppermint or rosehip to deal with a tension headache. In India, betel leaf is used to relieve intense headaches. Containing analgesic and cooling properties, it can be applied over the affected area with beneficial results. A few drops of Lavender essential oils can be used to massage the temple, relaxing the muscles and relieving pain. Try changing your diet - Avoid products that contain aspartame and MSG . These products have been known to trigger headaches, and 75 percent of reported adverse reactions to food additives are attributed to aspartame. Food additives like nitrates and nitrites found in processed food dilate blood vessels triggering headaches in some people sensitive to it. Try a massage - In a recent study published in the online journal Annals of Behavioral Medicine , it was revealed that massage therapy could be a nonpharmacologic treatment for migraine. In the said study, migraine sufferers were randomly assigned to massage or control conditions. The study concluded revealing massage participants exhibiting exceptional improvements in the frequency of migraine attacks as well as quality of sleep during the period of intervention and the follow-up which was conducted three weeks later. Moreover, an observation regarding a trend on the beneficial effects of massage was found. This was especially true as regards the individual participant's perceived stress and coping efficacy. During sessions, massage produced a decrease in state anxiety, heart rate and cortisol. Exercise - According to an article on selfnews.com, people who don't exercise are 14 percent more likely to experience headaches. A recent study in Sweden investigated the connection between exercise and its effects on headache. It involved 26 participants taking part in a 40 minute cycling exercise program conducted indoors, thrice a week for twelve weeks. The researchers monitored each participant's use of oxygen to measure the fitness level. The participants, for their part, recorded their migraine attacks during the said study. They also noted the days in which the migraines occurred, how intense they were and how much medication was used. At the conclusion of the study, participants were reporting less migraine attacks occurring less often and with less intensity. It was observed that maximum oxygen uptake noticeable increased.

Can we prevent migraines from happening? They say that prevention is better than cure, but does it apply to migraines as well? Research has revealed that migraines occur for a reason and are normally caused by triggers. These are factors, whether external or internal, that set a migraine in motion. Weather, food, changes in the daily schedule or hormonal changes have been identified as some of the triggers that could cause a migraine. For those who suffer from migraines, keeping a diary of migraine attacks could be an effective way of identifying your trigger. According to relieve-migraine-headache.com, the key to finding your trigger is taking stock of your activities 1-2 days before a migraine attack and finding out what's in common. It can be along process, but it is worth the effort. Identifying what can trigger a migraine is the best way of keeping it from affecting your quality of life. \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) For more than a year Health Canada held on to a report that concluded there is a 'strong relationship' between lung cancer and chrysotile asbestos mined in Canada. The report was authored by a panel of international experts and was received by Health Canada in March 2008. Trevor Ogden, the panel chairman for the report, made repeated requests to Health Canada to have the report made public, but the requests were resisted. Ogden referred to the delay as 'an annoying piece of needless government secrecy.' The report was obtained by Canadian media outlet Canwest News Service under Access to Information legislation, but only after 10 months of processing. The panel's report found a less certain connection between chrysotile asbestos and mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer. However, the report did find a strong connection between chrysotile asbestos and lung cancer, according to Ogden writing in an introductory letter. In the letter, Ogden, who is editor-in-chief of The Annals of Occupational Hygiene in Britain, also noted that the panel included members who have previously expressed opposing views on the subject, including industry consultant David Bernstein, who was previously involved with asbestos producer Union Carbide Corp, as well as Canadian and California asbestos mining companies. A Health Canada spokesman said the delay in releasing the report was due to taking time necessary to carefully review the report's findings and to consult other federal and provincial partners. Leslie Stayner, director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Illinois School of Public Health, commented on details of the report which also included amphibole asbestos as having a connection to risk of mesothelioma. 'The most important thing is what it doesn't say, which is some people have alleged it would say. What it doesn't say is that exposure to chrysotile asbestos is safe,' said Stayner. 'I think the bottom line here is that all forms of asbestos cause both mesothelioma and lung cancer. We will probably for many years still be debating this question of relative hazard of chrysotile. The fundamental question of whether it's hazardous or not is clear. I think the answer to that is, yes, chrysotile is a hazardous substance.' The report's release has reopened debate on the future of the asbestos industry in Canada , and particularly in the province of Quebec where the industry is concentrated. Member of Parliament Pat Martin, who has long been a supporter of a ban on Canada's asbestos industry, said the panel's conclusions should be taken seriously and should initiate government action on the matter. 'It makes our case. The reality is we're at a tipping point. The jig is up for the asbestos industry,' said Martin, who once worked in an asbestos plant in Yukon without being warned of the health risks. Most uses of asbestos are banned in Canada, and all uses for all forms of asbestos have been banned in Europe and Australia. But Canada remains one of the world's largest chrysotile asbestos exporters in the world with more than $100 million of exports in 2008, primarily to developing countries like India and Indonesia. Other countries that have imported Canadian asbestos since 2007 include the U.S., Columbia, Brazil, Peru, Pakistan, China, and Ecuador. Countries that have banned all types of asbestos without exceptions include Bulgaria, Egypt, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Uraguay, Chile, and Iceland. Chrysotile asbestos is the most commonly encountered form of asbestos, accounting for about 95% of asbestos found in the United States.

      " Yokohama Tire, the North American subsidiary of Yokohama Rubber Co. Ltd., has introduced a new tire that replaces much of its petroleum with oil derived from orange peels instead. 'The eco-focused dB Super E-spec mixes sustainable orange oil and natural rubber to drastically cut the use of petroleum, without compromising performance,' said Dan King, the company's vice president of sales. 'It also helps consumers save money at the gas pump by improving fuel efficiency via a 20-percent reduction in rolling resistance.' The tire, known by the moniker Super E-spec, is made from vulcanized rubber just like other tires. While most vulcanized rubber tires use petroleum combined with natural rubber, the Super E-spec has replaced 80 percent of its petroleum use with orange oil. The oil is extracted from what Yokohama calls a 'no-emission factory' and acquires orange peels from an orange juice factory next door. The Super E-spec has already been introduced into Yokohama's line of racing tires and is now used exclusively at the Porsche GT3 Cup race 'Patron GT3 Challenge.' It has been used in both short and 24-hour races. 'The idea of combining oil from orange peels with natural rubber was conceived by our racing engineers,' said director of corporate strategy and planning Mark Chung. 'The tire has been tested in racing applications to see what the true limitations are. The level of technology has matured to where we offer it for the passenger car lineup.' Initially, the Super E-spec will be offered in 15- and 16-inch diameters for hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius. Toyota Camry hybrid, Honda Civic hybrid and Honda Accord hybrid, as well as some non-hybrid cars including the Nissan Versa, Volkswagen Golf and natural gas-powered GX. Eventually, the tires will be offered in other sizes for both cars and sport-utility vehicles. The company has not released information on how the ecological impact of disposing of the Super E-spec compares with disposing of other tires.

      " Tens of millions of Americans are obese, and while figures have stabilized in recent years according to government findings , the numbers are still staggering. Poor dietary choices rank high as a cause of obesity, but another factor -- and in my view, one that gets far less attention -- is Americans' increasing lack of physical activity. In fact, a new study found that the average obese woman only gets one hour of vigorous exercise per year , while men don't get much more -- less than four per year. The findings, published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings , stem from the tracking of participants' movements over the course of a year. Researchers collected data regarding the amount of exercise participants engaged in and at what intensity level(s). Researchers defined vigorous exercise as jogging or other high-cardio-related, fat-burning exercises. For those who were considered extremely overweight, walking may be considered vigorous. For women especially, researchers cited extremely busy lives as a major reason why they exercised so little. Between work, caring for children and sleep, they noted, women did not have much time in the day to devote to fitness. 'They're living their lives from one chair to another,' Edward Archer, a research fellow with the Nutrition Obesity Research Center, told HealthDay . 'We didn't realize we were that sedentary. There are some people who are vigorously active, but it's offset by the huge number of individuals who are inactive.' Getting started in a fitness program Granted, finding the time to work in a fitness program is difficult in today's busy world. But almost everyone has time for some sort of activity 3-4 times per week, if they really want to change their lifestyle. So, the next hurdle to overcome is actually finding a fitness program that you can stick with . Most people who begin a fitness program don't stick with it, most often because it isn't the right program for them. So I asked a group of fitness experts what they would recommend for someone just beginning a fitness program: -- Gauge yourself. J. Anderson, certified personal trainer, selfnews contributor and founder/editor of Always Active Athletics , says to take some photos of yourself before you start your program and do some fitness tests, to see where you're at physically. 'If you are having a down day' after you begin a program, 'you can look at old photographs or re-take your fitness tests to see just how far you have really come.' Motivation . -- Don't attempt too much at first. Ainslie MacEachran, a certified personal trainer and cycling coach with Gemini Training Systems , located in Fort Collins, Colo., says you should set small goals initially. 'Break up your goals into little bit size pieces. Instead of trying to do it all at once, make little goals along the way that work towards your ultimate end goal,' she told me. -- Don't go it alone. Get a friend to start a program with you, says expert fitness trainer and former collegiate gymnastics star Kari Pearce of Innovative Fitness Trainers . 'Exercising with someone else often makes it more enjoyable and you will want to push yourself harder,' she told selfnews . -- Pick something fun. Kim Evans, a professional fitness coach at Wello in Grand Haven, Mich., says the dance-exercise Zumba might be a good fit for a beginner, mostly because the classes are inviting, not intimidating. 'That is a huge deal,' she told me, because 'many classes can be intimidating for the new exerciser.' Dr. Kim Chronister, a clinical psychologist and author of the book The Psychology Behind Fitness Motivation , agrees. She said in an email that a great way to get 'motivated is by finding fun activities to get into (i.e. dancing salsa for one hour or playing water polo for an hour).' -- Get in the right mindset. In order to stick with any program, you have to decide that it is for the long haul. 'When you take the time to transform your thoughts, beliefs and patterns, making lasting change is easy and effortless,' Michelle Hastie, of Total Body Health Solutions , said. -- Don't make excuses. It's easy to blow off your exercise session by convincing yourself that you don't have time today or something else 'came up,' says Josh Greene, who has a bachelor's degree in in Kinesiology from Indiana University and is currently a personal trainer at Anytime Fitness in Indianapolis. 'It takes as little as 20-30 minutes for someone to do a vigorous workout. And doing that 2-3 times per week is much more beneficial than someone doing absolutely nothing,' he told selfnews .

      " Tweet (NewsTarget) A lot of people are realizing the importance of upgrading their diets, but sometimes it's the change part where people get a little stuck. If that's what is going on with you, why not start adding green smoothies to your diet as a first (or second) step in the right direction. Greens are important blood builders and detoxifiers. They're also vitamin and mineral dense, but let's face it: most people don't eat anywhere near enough of them. Green smoothies are an easy and delicious way to change that. Bananas are often at the base of green smoothies, and if they're peeled and frozen first, they can add an ice cream like consistency. Of course, you can also add whatever other fruit you like. Apples, pineapple, Mexican (but not Hawaiian) papaya, watermelon, strawberries and grapes are all good options. Then, just add a cup or so of greens like spinach, parsley, or stemmed dinosaur kale, water, and a little of a natural sweetener. Then, blend and you're all set. A little stevia or organic honey can go a long way in making your green smoothies taste more like a dessert than a health food drink too. Many people find that adding green smoothies to their daily routine also boosts their energy levels - without coffee. Plus, it's an easy, delicious way to upgrade your diet - without even trying very hard. Greens are also chock full of chlorophyll, which helps us rebuild our blood, and it goes without saying that healthy blood is critical to healthy people. Clean and healthy blood also seems to add a vibrancy to people - so if you or your life is feeling a little dull, it's one way to start addressing a root cause of the problem. You can also power up your green smoothies with other super foods, like maca or the insides of a fresh aloe vera leaf. But, for taste and simplicity reasons, if you're just getting started on the health kick, it might be better to start slowly and add in more later, after you're already in the routine. Along with other fruit, or maybe soaked nuts, green smoothies make a great breakfast.

Cleaning Up! offers deep cleansing and using methods in this book, people have gotten rid of dozens of different types of health problems, as well as just losing excess weight, thinking more clearly, and feeling better. Kim's next book chronicles events in her life that happen to match patterns in the Bible. She's also found three places in the Bible that tell us its about these patterns and even asking you to match them. Here's a little from the upcoming book... In Isaiah 22:20, it says, 'And it must occur in that day that I will call my servant, namely Elia kim .' But, because these prophecies are cryptic and they aren't meant to be understood until they are understood, it's only the last three letters. A few lines later, it says, 'From the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them.' Here, you just take out any three middle letters, and again, it's the name of the person bringing you this message, or the sacred secret of the prophecy. Actually, if you take those two passages, Kim is about the only name you can get from both of them. In Numbers 1:1 1:18, it's talking about 'the family' and mentions Pagiel. It also twice mentions February 1st, (Kim's birthday) and then says that the youngest is 20 years old. Kim's little sister Paige is currently 20 years old. In Chronicles 1 11:20 it mentions the brother of Joab and then in the same sentence uses the word brandishing. Kim's middle name is Jo and her older sister's name is Brandi. There are other patterns to her sisters too but these sort of mention them by name. Of course, it helps if you know that there is a magical spiritual reality available that comes deep cleansing and often major dietary upgrades. It's also why Jesus was teaching the same thing, if you find his teachings in the Essene Gospel of Peace. In this text, he even says things like, 'You'll never see the father unless you clean your colon.' But, this is paraphrased... In the Bible Jesus says things more like, happy are those who wash their robes, as they can enter the tree of life. The tree of life is elsewhere explained as God's paradise. He also said, first clean the inside of the cup and then the outside will also be clean. Kim's book Cleaning Up! is here http://www.cleaningupcleanse.com .

      " Once again the corporate-owned, Left-wing mainstream media is serving as a Praetorian guard for President Barack Hussein Obama. In recent days The New York Times covered a rare visit by Obama to the National Counterterrorism Center, in which the paper initially published some very embarrassing comments the selfie-obsessed president made, but then memory-holed them later. As noted by The Federalist , the original story, written by reporters Peter Baker and Gardiner Harris and published Dec. 17, contained a stunning admission by the president following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. But by the next day Dec. 18 the embarrassing passage was removed. In a Twitter post, CNN 's Brian Stelter included the quote : In his meeting with the columnists, Mr. Obama indicated that he did not see enough cable television to fully appreciate the anxiety after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and made clear that he plans to step up his public arguments. Republicans were telling Americans that he is not doing anything when he is doing a lot, he said. The first New York Times version confirmed a version of Obama that his critics have long suspected that when it comes to issues of national security , this president is an out-of-touch and disinterested bystander. 'Obama critics immediately pounced on the stunning admission from the president, expressing shock that he would claim that a lack of TV time was the real reason for him not understanding Americans' anxiety about terrorism,' The Federalist reported. Pathetic But then, The Times went into protection mode and removed the offending passage from its online version of the story, and that drew the attention of other journalists and Times watchers, who questioned the deletion. That wasn't all The Times did to protect Obama, however. In addition to deleting the embarrassing section, as tracked by Newsdiffs.org , Times editors changed the piece's headline on four separate occasions, each time putting Obama in a better light or portraying Republicans in a worse light. As reported by The Federalist : The original headline when the story was first published was 'Obama Visiting National Counterterrorism Center.' Less than two hours later, the headline was 'Obama, at Counterterrorism Center, Offers Assurances On Safety.' Then the headline was changed to 'Frustrated by Republican Critics, Obama Defends Muted Response to Attacks.' Two hours later, the headline was once again revised to 'Under Fire From G.O.P., Obama Defends Response to Terror Attacks.' The most recent headline revision, which accompanied the deletion of the passage where Obama admitted he didn't understand the American public's anxiety about terrorism, now reads, 'Assailed by G.O.P., Obama Defends His Response To Terror Attacks.' What's even more comical and pathetic is The Times ' reporters 'explanation' of what editors did, a sort of 'nothing to see here, just move on' response. Changes made no sense In a statement to the Washington Examiner 's T. Beckett Adams they responded: Thanks for the question. There's nothing unusual here. That paragraph, near the bottom of the story, was trimmed for space in the print paper by a copy editor in New York late last night. But it was in our story on the web all day and read by many thousands of readers. Web stories without length constraints are routinely edited for print. Sure. Why all the headline changes, then? Crickets. Silence. No response. As noted by Sean Davis of The Federalist , however, the changes made no sense. ' NYT says it 'trimmed' the Obama quote for space. It deleted 66 words and added 116 in that revision,' he said in one tweet. 'The NYT's excuse that it was just 'trimming for space' makes no sense. Its revision of that section added 50 words,' he said in another. The Times has been in the tank for Obama since he got the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. To expect the paper to now change the way it has protected him is ludicrous. But every time it does, the paper needs to be exposed for doing so.

      " Although prescription drug abuse among both children and adults now rivals illegal street drugs in both prevalence and lethality, most parents are not particularly concerned about such abuse among children and teenagers, according to the most recent University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health. In addition, parental support is weak for many proposed policies that could help restrict access to commonly abused narcotic painkillers like Oxcycontin or Vicodin. 'This is a national problem and a growing problem,' researcher Sarah J. Clark said. 'The results of this poll are a signal that parents may not be aware of the significant rates of misuse of narcotic pain medicine, which highlights the tremendous challenge of addressing this national problem.' Only 35 percent of parents said that they were 'very concerned' about the misuse of narcotic painkillers (opioids) by children and teenagers in their own communities. Even fewer - 19 percent - were very concerned about the misuse of such drugs in their own families. Strikingly, white parents had the lowest rates of concern (13 percent) about abuse in their families, compared with Hispanic (26 percent) or black (38 percent parents), even though painkiller abuse is three times higher among white teenagers than among black or Hispanic teenagers. White parents were also significantly less likely than black or Hispanic parents to support policies that would limit children's access to prescription painkillers. Parents underestimate seriousness of problem Recent studies have shown that more overdose deaths are caused by narcotic painkillers than by cocaine and heroin combined. Nationwide, rates of prescription drug abuse now equal or outstrip those of all illegal street drugs combined. In addition, studies have shown that 75 percent of narcotic painkiller abusers obtain the drugs from someone with a valid prescription - typically either themselves, a friend or a relative. The new poll confirmed the ease with which children and teenagers can obtain such drugs: 35 percent of parents said that they had received at least one pain drug for their children in the past five years, with half of these being narcotics. 66 percent of parents had received a prescription painkiller for at least one household adult in the past five years. Yet, nearly 50 percent of parents surveyed said they did not support requirements that people return unused pain drugs to a doctor or pharmacy, and 59 percent did not favor a requirement that painkiller prescription refills be obtained only from a doctor's office. 66 percent of parents did support laws that would require parents to show identification before purchasing a narcotic painkiller for a child, while 57 percent supported regulations prohibiting people from obtaining a narcotic painkiller prescription from more than one doctor. But in general, the researchers noted, the parental responses indicated a low level of concern about the problem. 'Recent estimates are that one in four high school seniors have ever used a narcotic pain medicine. However, parents may downplay the risks of narcotic pain medicine because they are prescribed by a doctor,' Clark said.

      " Tweet (NewsTarget) Malnutrition shaves as much as three percent off the production of some of the poorest countries in the world, but obesity could soon affect economic output as severely as malnutrition, according to findings from the World Bank as of this week. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that obesity has tripled in the past twenty years and in addition, 10 percent of children and 20 percent of adults will be obese in Europe and Central Asia by the year 2010 unless some kind of action is taken. Dr. Meera Shekar -- senior nutrition specialist with the World Bank -- said that malnutrition cuts two to three percent off of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the hardest-hit countries -- and the growing rate of obesity could do the same. Dr. Shekar says 'We suspect that these estimates will be just as high' for obesity. Six percent of health costs in the WHO's European region already comes from obesity in adults. For example, obesity cost France $6.41 billion in direct costs alone in 2002, while cost the state of California $22 billion in the year 2000, including indirect costs. As obesity is also expected to reduce life expectancy, it could have a direct impact on the global economy as well. A recent study in Britain forecasted that men would live five years less by 2050 if current trends were not reversed regarding the global obesity problem. Dr. Shekar said, 'The important thing is that because the problem is increasing we would see an increasing drain on economies, particularly developing economies,' while adding that obesity had appeared recently in the Middle East and North Africa -- and was turning out to be a big problem in Latin America. The prevalence of obesity seems to shift to the poor from the rich in developing countries -- and this has happened in France, where obesity is five times more prevalent among low-income groups than high earners according to WHO Regional Adviser Dr. Franceso Branca. ### \n",
      " New research in the August 1 issue of Cancer reveals that men diagnosed with prostate cancer tend to rush into their decision on treatment, as well as make those decisions based on inaccurate beliefs about the disease. Conventional medicine generally offers four treatment options for prostate cancer patients: removal of the prostate gland; 'seeding' the cancer with radioactive material; externally radiation; or cryptotherapy, which freezes the tumor. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with 20 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients after treatment options had been explained by a urologist. They discovered that 19 of the 20 patients chose a course of treatment based partly on the experiences of a friend or relative who'd had the disease. The study's lead author, Dr. Thomas D. Denberg, stressed that prostate cancer patients should avoid comparing their own cancer experience the experiences of others. 'Because Uncle Fred did well with a certain procedure doesn't mean that you will,' Denberg said. Though all the patients in the study said they understood that the cancer progressed slowly, 12 patients wanted treatment as soon as possible, eight of which believed that surgery was the best option. Patients also made treatment decisions based on the misconceptions that a cure was guaranteed if the tumor was confined to the prostate, and that the chance of being cured was still high even if the tumor spread beyond the prostate. Researchers also found that the men who had decided on surgery rejected the other options, and the men who opted for radiation therapy preferred seeding over external radiation, citing efficacy and possible negative side effects. The study's authors say that men should not rush into a treatment decision, and should educate themselves on the disease to avoid common misperceptions. Proponents of alternative cancer treatments say that men should also look into safe, natural treatments for prostate cancer, including vitamin D from sunlight, green tea and the minerals selenium and zinc. Pomegranate juice has recently been discovered to markedly slow the growth of prostate cancer tumors. ### \n",
      " Middle-age-spread is a real issue for both men and women who step into their 40s. As the metabolism slows down with age, and the muscle mass is reduced as well, it's increasingly difficult for the body to burn fat and stay fit. Although some handle it better than others, middle age is far from a breezy walk through the park for most people. Under these stressful circumstances, some people find comfort in food or alcohol, both of which also tend to show around the waist. But it's not all hopeless for those trying to fight the dreaded middle-age-spread. According to a new study of large proportions published in the journal BMJ , a minor change in diet can actually help you stay slim throughout your 40s. Here's how. The BMJ study on flavonoids and weight changes The BMJ study was the largest of its kind so far. It involved more than 124,000 middle aged and older people, who self-reported their weight once every two years, and their diet once every four years. The researchers analyzed this data over 24 years and, after adjusting for smoking and fitness activities, discovered that people who ate more flavonoid-rich foods maintained their weight better or even lost a few pounds. Flavonoids are natural compounds found in plants, where they perform a number of important roles. For instance, they are responsible for the proper communication between plant cells, as well as for creating attractive colors for bees and butterflies, which can help with pollination. Some flavonoid-heavy foods are strawberries, bananas, grapes, pears, onions, prunes, peppers, green tea and many others, but also chocolate and wine. It seems that with human beings, flavonoids might prevent unwanted weight gain. While most adults between 18 and 49 tend to gain one or two pounds every year, those involved in the study who adhered to a flavonoid-rich diet gained an average of 0.16 to 0.23 fewer pounds every four years. Berries showed the best results Different foods contain different types of flavonoids. The flavonoids that showed the best results in relation to weight gain were the anthocyanin, which can be found in strawberries, blackberries, blueberries , cherries, grapes, radishes and blackcurrants. Flavonoid polymers found in apples and green tea also showed promising results, as did the flavonols commonly found in tea and onions . While the results of the study might not seem impressive to those looking to lose weight fast, they are nevertheless extremely promising for people dreading the middle-age-spread. For them, it was outstanding news that something as simple as eating a handful of their favorite berries can help them maintain their weight throughout their 40s. <='' h1=''>The study published in the journal BMJ was only observational, but its authors had more in mind than the weight of the participants. As it is today, most Americans don't even eat one cup of fruit or two cups of veggies per day. By showing that some fruits like berries can be linked to weight loss, the researchers hoped to encourage people to eat more fruit overall. What's more, earlier studies on flavonoids indicated potential health benefits other than maintaining a desirable weight. Indeed, flavonoid-rich foods were shown to increase energy expenditure and therefore decrease fat absorption, while also working as efficient anti-inflammatories. The intake of flavonoids has been associated with a decreased risk of certain cancers, as well as with the support of the cardiovascular and nervous systems. At the end of the day, you just can't go wrong by eating a few more of your favorite berries. Not only will they help you maintain your desired weight through middle age, but they're also likely to help you fight a score of other life-threatening diseases.

      " The Obama Administration could not build a functional health insurance exchange website despite spending a mind-boggling $2.1 billion of taxpayer money, but now feels it is capable of essentially managing the entire Internet. On February 26, a small group of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats -- three, to be exact -- voted to give the federal government the instant authority to reclassify the Internet from a free, uninhibited mode of communication and commerce into a 'public utility' the same as your old phone company, so it can now be 'better regulated' -- and all under the phony guise of making everything more 'fair.' Now, when Comcast or Verizon provide services to your home, they will have to do so 'in the public interest,' whatever that means. In a partisan move, the Federal Communications Commission's two Democrat members and its Democrat chairman voted to approve the new reclassification and associated rules over the objections of the panel's two Republican members. As Fox News and other media reported, the rules remained secret right up to the vote, though one member, Republican Ajit Pai, tried to sound the alarm about the bogus nature of the plan -- and against FCC panel rules -- in the days before the vote . Nothing is broken In an interview with Reason magazine online, Pai called the so-called 'Net Neutrality' rules a 'solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist.' 'Nowhere in the 332-page document that I've received will anyone find the FCC detailing any kind of systemic harm to consumers, and it seems to me that should be the predicate for certainly any kind of preemptive regulation--some kind of systemic problem that requires an industry-wide solution,' Pai said. 'That simply isn't here.' A report by Investor's Business Daily noted that the FCC has been down this road before, and has been slapped by the federal court which hears regulatory cases: Neutrality rules have barred ISPs from blocking or purposely slowing down Internet traffic. But a Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals ruling in January 2014 gutted much of the FCC's authority. It's not clear how the court would view the new rules, but what is certain is that the big telecoms are sure to challenge them. Still, the public remains largely unaware of the scope of the new rules and just what Net Neutrality is. As some media have reported, grassroots support is high, but that's odd because, as Ars Technica pointed out, with the exception of the FCC commissioners, no one knows what the rules actually say. 'The full net neutrality order has not been published yet,' the website noted. 'A solution that won't work' There is also substantial criticism over the issue of President Obama interfering with the function of what is supposed to be an independent commission. 'Let me start by issuing apologies. First, I am just sick about what Chairman Wheeler was forced to go through during this process. It was disgraceful to have the Administration overtake the commission's rulemaking process and dictate an outcome for pure political purposes,' wrote Republican Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, in a dissent. 'It is so disturbing to know that those efforts were about illegitimately pushing a larger political cause mostly unrelated to technology. This administration went so far beyond what has ever been attempted, and its inappropriate interference in the commission's activities will forever change this institution,' O'Rielly added. Both of the Republican commissioners have predicted that the new Net Neutrality rules, which are scheduled to take effect in 60 days barring a legal challenge, will fail to accomplish what the administration and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler say they will do. 'What doesn't make sense, and has never made sense, is to take a regulatory framework developed for Ma Bell in the 1930s and make her great grandchildren, with technologies and options undreamed of eighty years ago, live under it,' Jim Cicconi, AT&T;'s senior executive vice president of external and legislative affairs, told USA Today in a statement.

      " Tweet Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) who took part in hypnotherapy sessions reported reduced symptoms and improved quality of life, according to research published in the June issue of Journal of Clinical Nursing. Dr Graeme D Smith from University of Edinburgh studied 75 patients with IBS - which affects up to one in seven adults - before and after they took part in four to five treatment sessions over three months. He discovered that before the sessions, women were most concerned with quality of life issues such as diet and energy and that men had the highest levels of anxiety and depression and worried about their physical role. The 20 men and 55 women who took part in the study reported that hypnotherapy brought about significant improvements in the physical and emotional symptoms related to IBS. These included a 30 per cent improvement in their emotional quality of life and a 25 per cent improvement in energy levels. Mental health improved by 21 per cent, sleep by 18 per cent, physical health by 16 per cent and diet by 14 per cent. The participants also reported that their social role had improved by 20 per cent and their physical role by 18 per cent. Average anxiety levels fell by 12 per cent and depression fell by four per cent. Men showed higher levels of both problems before the hypnotherapy sessions, but also reported greater improvements than women. The people taking part in the study also reported a five per cent reduction in abdominal pain and a four per cent reduction in abdominal bloating. 'It is estimated that between 10 to 15 per cent of adults may suffer from IBS and that the physical, emotional, social and economic consequences of the illness can be considerable' says Dr Smith, from the University's School of Health (Nursing Studies). 'Physical symptoms include altered bowel habits, abdominal pain and bloating, together with other non-intestinal problems such as lethargy, problems sleeping and indigestion. Anxiety and psychosocial problems are also common and these can have a detrimental impact on quality of life.' The 75 study participants underwent hypnotherapy sessions that focussed on creating images of their gut symptoms using visualisation techniques in conjunction with relaxation methods. Self-hypnosis was taught at an early stage and patients were given audio tapes, that reinforced the effects of the hypnotherapy, to use at home. They also completed detailed questionnaires before and after treatment and kept diary cards during the study 'The patients involved in this study were typical of people seen routinely in gastroenterology clinics, where up to 50 per cent of the referrals are for IBS' says Dr Smith. 'There's no universal agreement about what causes IBS and traditional treatment is often disappointing. This study shows that hypnotherapy can effectively reduce symptoms and improve quality of life and underlines the valuable role that complementary therapies can play in modern healthcare.' \n",
      " Instead of opting for potentially harmful mainstream acne medications, try safe and effective natural remedies for acne problems. You may find your acne and associated problems such as redness and light scarring completely gone or greatly improved in as little as two weeks or less. Natural Acne Remedies Lemon juice, tea-tree oil and aqueous cream Before going to bed, bathe or shower and shampoo. Next, apply lemon juice over your face (this will itch for a minute or two). Rub in a small amount of pure tea-tree oil. Then, apply a thick layer of aqueous cream to your face and leave on overnight, lying on your back if you must. Or, after about half an hour or so, rub the cream in. Help this and other remedies along by eating three kiwifruit and about 3/4 cup of raw carrots daily. Oatmeal, vinegar, raspberries, egg, sea salt Pour some oatmeal into a small bowl. Mash up some raspberries and mix them with about a teaspoon of sea salt and the oatmeal. Add about two tablespoons of vinegar and one egg and mix with a spoon until it makes a pasty mix. Wash your face with an exfoliating scrub (such as apricot scrub) or exfoliate with a loofah. Steam your face and then apply the mixture thickly. Leave on for about 30 minutes or until the mixture is somewhat dry and starts to crumble off. Rinse with cold water. Honey and cinnamon Take three tablespoons of honey and one tablespoon of cinnamon and make a paste. Put it on the affected area and apply it in circles. Leave it on while you sleep and wash it off in the morning Lemon juice, H2O2, willow bark, aloe, echinacea and goldenseal Mix in a bowl or container some lemon juice, a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, willow bark powder, echinacea and goldenseal. Mix together and use this solution as an astringent. Apply w/ cotton balls or tissue and leave it on your face to dry. Once it dries, put aloe vera on your skin. Do this twice daily after first washing your face. Fresh basil leaves Take a small handful of fresh basil leaves (available at most grocery stores). Let the leaves simmer in two cups of water for about 15 minutes and then put the mixture in the refrigerator to chill. Apply the mixture to troubled areas or your entire face with a cotton ball. Gets rid of acne and also helps with any existing scarring. Egg white Dab a little egg white on pimples and leave it on overnight or sometimes apply it all over your face or affected area. You'll likely notice results the next morning. Pimples/zits are reduced or gone, and your skin feels great. Apple cider vinegar Soak a cotton ball in cider vinegar and add salt to the cotton ball. Apply to infected area and hold there for as long as you can. This should instantly reduce the swelling. Works well for large cystic acne as well. Other natural acne remedies include: \n",
      " Eating just a few ounces of broccoli each day may significantly reduce a person's risk of ulcers and stomach cancer, researchers from Johns Hopkins University have found. In a study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research , scientists assigned 50 people in Japan to eat either 2.5 ounces of broccoli sprouts or 2.5 ounces of alfalfa sprouts each day for two months. Broccoli, a cruciferous vegetable, contains high levels of the protective phytochemical sulforaphane. Alfalfa is not a cruciferous vegetable and contains no sulforaphane. At the beginning and end of the study, the researchers analyzed participant stool samples for a chemical called HpSA, known to be a reliable marker of infection with the Heliobacter pylori bacterium. H. pylori causes chronic inflammation of the stomach lining, significantly increasing the risk of stomach cancer and duodenal or stomach ulcers. While 25 to 30 percent of people in the United States carry the bacteria in their stomachs, 80 percent show no symptoms of the infection. Infection rates are much higher in Japan, at nearly 90 percent, due in part to crowding. The researchers found that among those who ate broccoli sprouts, HpSA levels decreased 40 percent by the end of the experiment. Participants were then told to stop eating broccoli sprouts. After another two months, HpSA levels had returned to pre-study levels. Consumption of alfalfa sprouts had no effect on HpSA levels. 'H. pylori is a known carcinogen,' Fahey said. 'The fact that we were able to reduce the effects of an infectious agent that is also a carcinogen gives us hope that if someone were to eat broccoli sprouts or broccoli regularly, it would reduce levels of H. pylori and, over a period of many years, reduce the chance that they would get that cancer. It is not proven, but the results are highly suggestive.' The researchers also found that inflammation levels in the stomach were reduced by consumption of broccoli sprouts. 'The fact that the levels of infection and inflammation were reduced suggests the likelihood of getting gastritis and ulcers and cancer is probably reduced,' Fahey said. 'The evidence is all pointing toward broccoli or broccoli sprouts being able to prevent cancer in humans.' The researchers believe that much of broccoli's protective benefit comes from its high levels of sulforaphane. In addition to functioning as an antibiotic, this chemical stimulates the body to reduce a number of enzymes with different health benefits. Prior research has shown that some of these enzymes protect the skin from sun damage, while others act to reduce inflammation or prevent heart disease. In a second experiment, the same team of researchers fed H. pylori-infected mice either plain water or broccoli-sprout smoothies for eight weeks. They then examined the animals' stomachs for levels of H. pylori. Infection levels had not changed in mice drinking water, but were significantly reduced in the broccoli group. When the researchers genetically engineered another group of mice for inability to activate certain protective enzymes, however, a diet of broccoli-sprout smoothies had no effect on H. pylori infection. According to Steven H. Zeisel of the University of North Carolina, who was not involved in the study, sulforaphane also stimulates the body to produce liver enzymes that help deactivate carcinogens. 'People who eat more broccoli tune up their liver and other cells to destroy cancer-causing agents,' he said. Although cooking has been shown to reduce sulforaphane levels by 90 percent, Zeisel said that even two to three ounces of cooked broccoli per day would provide a benefit. Other vegetables also stimulate the body's anti-cancer mechanisms, he added, recommending an increase in 'the amount of plants in the diet.' He warned that supplements alone can not provide the same benefit as a diet high in vegetables. 'It's probably a combination of ingredients in the plant that is responsible,' he said. 'When you try to extract them out to make a pill, it usually doesn't work.' Sources for this story include: news.bbc.co.uk; www.app.com . \n",
      " The multi-million dollar infertility industry offers a huge list of expensive -- and often invasive -- tests and procedures to help couples who have difficulty conceiving, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Unfortunately, assisted reproduction technologies (ART) can have a dark side that'srarely mentioned by the mainstream media. High tech baby making procedures are increasingly being linked to an increased risk of congenital malformations as well a greater chance for several diseases down the road ( http://www.selfnews.com/029116_infertilit... ). But now a new systematic review of research by New Zealand scientists just published in The Cochrane Library provides evidence a natural therapy could be a solution to fertility problems in many men. The study found that men who take antioxidant supplements are significantly more likely to get their partners pregnant (the regular old-fashioned non-ART way) than men who don't take the supplements. Less-than-optimal fertility, known as subfertility, affects about one in 20 men. In the new research paper, investigators in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand pointed out that chemicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are cause damage to cells, especially sperm cells. This may explain why some men have lowered sperm counts which can interfere with their ability to fertilize eggs. But a host of antioxidants , including certain vitamins and minerals, are known to reduce the damage created by ROS. The review zeroed in on 34 trials totaling 2,876 couples undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, including in vitro fertilization and sperm injections. Most men in these studies had been found to have low sperm counts or low sperm motility. The research trials examined all involved treating the men with many different types of oral antioxidants, including vitamin E, L-carnitine, zinc and magnesium. The results showed that, compared to controls, a woman was far more likely to become pregnant if her partner took antioxidants. Other trials examined the effects of antioxidants on sperm concentration and motility and also found mostly positive improvements with antioxidant supplementation. 'When trying to conceive as part of an assisted reproductive program, it may be advisable to encourage men to take oral antioxidant supplements to improve their partners' chances of becoming pregnant,' said lead researcher Marian Showell, in a media statement. She added that the research team didn't have enough data comparing different antioxidants to reach any conclusions about which supplements may be the most effective in helping men achieve fatherhood. 'We need more head-to-comparisons to understand whether any one antioxidant is performing better than any other,' Dr. Showell said.

      " In 2013, the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services killed more than 4 million animals, an ironic twist of fate for an agency that is supposedly charged with preserving and protecting the country's wildlife. The Washington Post reports, the massive toll of wild animals exterminated by the government -- as a service to everything from ranches to airports -- has gone up and down, but last year, the figures were up again: The more than 4 million animals shot, poisoned, snared or trapped by the Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services in fiscal year 2013 included 75,326 coyotes, 866 bobcats, 528 river otters, 3,700 foxes, 12,186 prairie dogs, 973 red-tailed hawks, 419 black bears and at least three eagles, golden and bald. For the record, it is against federal law to kill a Bald or Golden Eagle without first obtaining a permit to do so (accompanied by a good reason) from the Interior Secretary. Kill totals up and down but no one says why The Post said that, despite the fact that the USDA maintains a list of animals killed, there is virtually no data showing why each animal was exterminated, the methods used in the killings or the reasons why they were necessary. Also, there isn't much data indicating reasons behind mistakes that have led to massive kills of animals that weren't targeted. At least two members of Congress have described the Wildlife Services as secretive and opaque for failing to provide more information. Further, there are mounting calls for an investigation into how the service operates. Officials with the USDA's Wildlife Services said the agency responds to requests by other government entities nationwide while working to 'resolve human/wildlife conflicts' in a strategic way. 'As wildlife damage increases, requests for assistance also increase,' spokeswoman Carol Bannerman told the Post . She said that ranchers and farmers pay half the costs of the agency's expenses to kill animals that they view as a threat. However, she provided no explanation about why the kill total is as low as 1.5 million in one year but as high as 5 million the next. Around the turn of the 21st century, the agency said it killed about 4 million animals, but two years later, in 2001, the figure fell to 1. 5 million and remained relatively low for about six years. But in 2008, the number rose dramatically, to 5 million, before heading down to 3 million over the next four years, the Post reported. But as evidenced by current figures, the death toll is up again, and critics are looking for a better explanation as to why. According to the Post : Wildlife Services' primary purpose is to eradicate invasive creatures introduced from other parts of the world. They include greedy feral hogs, giant swamp rats called nutria, big aggressive Argentine lizards called tegus and swarms of hungry starlings that destroy the habitats of animals native to the United States. But the agency also kills native animals en masse, sometimes based solely on a homeowner's or farmer's perception of a threat. 'Rogue agency' Birds that inhabit airports and eat cattle feed at farms do contribute to the high totals. Non-invasive European starlings, sparrows, pigeons and the like account for about 87 percent of animals killed. Birds of all kinds are singled out as nuisances, and flocks of them can be particularly hazardous to air travel. But as the Post noted, the current rise in the number of animals being exterminated came despite growing protest and scrutiny. Last December, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition with the government, demanding that the agency provide a better explanation as to why it makes each kill of an animal, who benefited from the killing and the methods used. In the petition, the Center called the Wildlife Services 'a rogue agency' that was 'out of control.' Sources: http://www.washingtonpost.com http://www.ecorazzi.com http://www.predatordefense.org \n",
      " Researchers from ATM Metabolics say they have isolated a chemical, naturally occurring in fruits and vegetables, that protects the body from the diabetes-producing effects of sugars. ATM Metabolics is a research company specializing in treatment of metabolic and neurological disorders. The researchers isolated and tested a chemical, which they call simulin, and found that it accelerated the removal of excess sugar from the bloodstream, increased the sensitivity of insulin receptors, reduced the amount of carbohydrates absorbed, and reduced the amount of glucose manufactured by the liver. It also helped '[mobilize] carbohydrates from the fat cells.' Calling simulin a 'sugar defense mechanism,' the researchers said their findings suggested the chemical helps the body deal with sugar's potentially harmful effects. If added to foods and beverages, they said, it might help protect against diabetes and even allow diabetics to eat sugary foods again. Simulin is not a sweetener, but rather a compound that could be added to already sweetened products. The researchers have speculated that the chemical evolved as a way to encourage animals to eat more fruit by protecting them against diabetes. 'Fruit plants depend on their fruits being eaten to spread, so it makes sense that they would do everything they could to keep their fruit on the menu,' said researcher Daryl Thompson. 'This could be why humans didn't become diabetic despite eating so much sugar in fruit and vegetables.' Thompson said that further studies of simulin's effects are underway to clear the way for its use as a commercial food additive. He said that because the product is natural, it should not need to receive special FDA approval, and could probably achieve Generally Recognized As Safe status. For the same reason, he expects companies and consumers to line up once the product is ready. 'We've had a good response from the food industry,' he said, 'and we think consumers will accept it because it is natural.' \n",
      " A small deciduous tree or large shrub that bears fruit, the Punica granatum , commonly known as the pomegranate, is a superfood with a long and rich history. Native to the East, it can be traced through historical documents as far back as 4000 B.C. The red fruit grows from pretty red flowers and is between a lemon and a grapefruit in size. The white flesh inside the thick skin is full of several hundred seeds. Pomegranates are grown as both a fruit crop and as ornamental trees or shrubs for parks and gardens. They are tolerant of drought and moderate frost, growing in climates similar to the Mediterranean region, California, or Northern India. There are many genotypes, with the differences ranging from exocarp and aril color, hardness of seed, fruit size, juice content and astringency, and so on. The pomegranate has become increasingly popular in the countries of North America over the last few decades. The pomegranate is one of the world's most ancient foods The name pomegranate comes from Medieval Latin meaning 'seeded apple.' It has been named in many ancient texts from the Book of Exodus in the Torah, the Quran, the Homeric Hymns, and Mesopotamian records, to name a few. The pomegranate originally came from Persia, or modern day Iran, and the western Himalayas. It has been cultivated for millennia in places such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Russia, and the Mediterranean region ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate ). It migrated as far east as China and Southeast Asia and was found along the Silk Road as a symbol of abundance and posterity. It is also grown extensively in Korea, Japan, and Latin America, having been introduced there by settlers or traders. Archaeologists have found carbonized pomegranate exocarps in places such as Jericho from the Early Bronze Age (3000 BC), Cyprus, from the Late Bronze Age, and in Egyptian tombs, including King Tut's. Pomegranates were highly valued in Ancient Egypt, and were part of the supply of fruits required in a pharaoh's residence (1600 BC). It was revered enough to have been painted on walls and tombs to symbolize life after death. The pomegranate had many uses, including the fruit as food, the juice as a tonic to kill parasites, the blossom was crushed to make a red dye, and the peel was used to dye leather. ( http://www.pomwonderful.com ) Other ancient sightings of the pomegranate include on the pillars of the Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, on the robes of Jewish priests, and in mosaics from ancient Rome (including Pompeii) where it was called the 'Phoenician apple.' Its twigs were worn on Roman women's headdresses to signify marital status. In Zoroastrian temples, pomegranates were used to symbolize eternal life and were associated with fertility. A symbol of strength in ancient Persia, the army of Xerxes carried spears with pomegranates on the tip (instead of spikes) when they invaded Greece in 480 BC. ( http://www.foodreference.com/html/a-pomegranate-history.html ). Pomegranates were also depicted on the walls of the royal palace and fortress Alhambra of the Islamic Nasrid Dynasty by the Moors in Spain. They even renamed one of their cities after the fruit. It also has a place of significance in Armenian culture. More than just a nutritious food source, the pomegranate was an integral part of many cultures. In many cases, the pomegranate surpassed its status as a highly celebrated source of food, and became part of the lore and legends of a culture. It was celebrated by the Buddha, and was considered one of the three blessed fruits, often being represented in Buddhist art. It was also depicted on the Temple of the Founder of Zen, to honor Bodhidharma. Another example is how prominently the pomegranate was featured in Greek myths (approximately 500 BC). Most of us remember how Hades tempted Persephone with a pomegranate, and when she partook, it bound her to him as pomegranates symbolize the indissolubility of marriage. This is how Greek legend explains the seasons: when Persephone is in the Underworld with her husband, it is winter; when she rejoins her mother every year, we have spring. Pomegranates have been a central part of many religions. Over the centuries, pomegranates were featured on Jewish money, furnishings, and religious objects. Around 600 AD Islam's Muhammad had high regard for the pomegranate, considering it to be nutritious for both physical and emotional health. Legend has it that each pomegranate contains one aril descended directly from paradise ( http://www.foodreference.com/html/a-pomegranate-history.html ). By 1500 AD, the pomegranate had also become an important symbol in Christianity, representing Jesus' resurrection. It was also used to symbolize The Virgin Mary because 'both are filled with sweetness,' and like a pomegranate she is said 'to have within her many benefits for humankind, all revealed in Christ.' (EDITOR'S NOTE: NOT SURE IF WE SHOULD LEAVE THIS PART ABOUT JESUS AND MARY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?) In India, the pomegranate has been a Hindu symbol of prosperity and fertility for centuries and is thought to bring good health. The pomegranate is featured prominently in Hindu art, being found on several avatars of Ganesha. ( http://www.pomwonderful.com/about/pomegranate-history-legend/asia/ ) As the pomegranate made its way to Europe, it had become more of a symbol than a food, and was portrayed regularly in art, literature, religion, and mythology. Eventually the western cultures come to value the pomegranate for its medicinal properties, and it was featured in heraldry, being found on the heraldic crests of many medical institutions including the British Medical Association ( http://www.pomwonderful.com/about/pomegranate-history-legend/europe/ ). As it spread throughout Europe, the pomegranate came to appear on several coats of arms and symbolize noble birth. The pomegranate made it to the new world via Spanish missionaries. When Cortez conquered the Aztecs in the 1500s, pomegranate trees were planted in Mexico, then made their way north to missions in California and Texas. It spread across the south but did not do well in the northern climates. In 1771, Thomas Jefferson planted pomegranates at Monticello, his plantation in Virginia. Around the year 2000, pomegranate popularity began to grow again as this sweet, juicy, succulent fruit was rediscovered. It's availability around the United States increased as a result.

Pomegranates are one of the most popular superfoods readily available today The pomegranate became popular in the Middle Eastern civilizations 6000 years ago largely because its dense nutrition and juice provided sustenance for long journeys. The superfood status of the pomegranate has only grown in modern times as nutritional research has come to decipher and understand the true power of the pomegranate's phytonutrients. India's Ayurvedic medicine has used pomegranates as a source for traditional remedies for thousands of years. For example, the bark of the tree and the fruit rind is used to stem diarrhea, dysentery, bladder problems, mouth ulcers, and intestinal parasites while the seeds and juice are considered a tonic for the heart. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate ) The seeds in their casings, or arils, are the most desired part of the pomegranate, and they are consumed raw. Pomegranate juice can be sweet or sour depending on the variety, but most are moderate with some astringent notes due to the acidic tannins. Pomegranates are rich in vitamin C, pantothenic acid, potassium, flavonoids, and other natural phenols such as ellagitannins, a powerful antioxidant. The pomegranate also has unsaturated oils, fiber, and many additional micronutrients, if you eat the seeds. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate ) Some miscellaneous uses of pomegranates many may not know include that it is often used as a bonsai tree and that pomegranate juice is sweetened and thickened to make grenadine syrup for cocktails. Throughout most of recorded history, our ancestors have had high regard for the pomegranate. Its immune boosting phytonutrients have shown to be an effective tool in preventing degenerative and inflammatory ailments such as cancer, heart disease, and arthritis ( http://www.selfnews.com/031068_pomegranate_superfood.html ). Current research underway includes studies on how pomegranate components affect diseases such as diabetes, cancer, rhinovirus, the common cold, coronary artery disease, kidney disease, and brain injury. \n",
      " The mainstream, legacy media is continuing to struggle for attention as more and more Americans abandon their propaganda for the truth and salvation of independent and alternative media information sites. Agence France-Presse reports that the value of Old Media has dropped significantly in recent years, especially the traditional newspaper industry, as it has struggled to cope with the rising New Media landscape. This was epitomized recently by the sale of the San Diego Union-Tribune in early May for $85 million, AFP said, which 'underscored the horrific slump in the value of 'old media' companies' in the past several years. AFP further reported: Although the sum paid by Tribune Publishing was only marginally below the $110 million in a 2011 sale of the San Diego group and excluded some valuable real estate, the newspaper was believed to be worth as much as $1 billion as late as 2004. Revenues decline as investment dollars in digital platforms remain scarce This story is being repeated at major metro dailies all over the country. In fact, the Pew Research Center says that valuations of the Boston Globe , Philadelphia Inquirer , Minneapolis Star-Tribune , and Chicago Sun-Times are all down by more than 90 percent of their peaks. While these and other legacy papers are attempting to retain readership by offering digital subscriptions and mobile apps, such efforts appear to be too little, too late for many. For U.S. dailies over the past 10 years, weekday circulation has dropped off 17 percent. In addition, ad revenue has fallen by more than 50 percent as advertisers turn to online dailies and other media, Pew noted. The financial hemorrhaging got so bad last year for three large media companies that they opted to spin off newspapers so they could concentrate more on profitable enterprises like broadcast or digital properties. 'Every newspaper chain talks about getting digital faster. The plain truth is that despite almost two decades of effort, most aren't close to where they need to be,' Ken Doctor, an industry analyst who is the author of the Newsonomics blog and consultant for the research firm Outsell, told AFP. In short order, Doctor predicts, newspapers won't be left with many options except to cut the frequency of their print editions, as several dailies have already done. Alternatively, they might opt to go completely digital, as some have chosen to do. That latter option is easier said than done, however. Developing a user-friendly digital platform that retains some of the print version's identity is expensive, and since ad revenues for the industry have not increased since 2008, it is more difficult to invest in digital because the funds are simply not there. During the first quarter of this year, seven of the biggest newspaper groups only generated a combined profit of $21 million. In 2005, the massive Gannett group alone earned $1.8 billion. 'These companies have little to invest,' Doctor said. 'They're still paying off debt, issuing dividends, keeping up with pension obligations, and anticipating print ad results that can't find a bottom.' The red ink will continue to flow Even the legacy starship paper The New York Times , which as been one of the most aggressive in shifting to digital news, acknowledged recently that 70 percent of its income is derived from the print editions. What is the solution? Alan Mutter, a former Chicago newspaper editor who now consults on digital news, told AFP that newspaper groups should rethink their strategy and act more like startups. 'People in the media business have to recognize they're not in the print or broadcasting business, they are in the business of attracting audiences' to sell advertising, he said. Other papers are beginning to partner with huge digital brands such as Facebook, Google and other media companies that have a global reach. In the meantime, the legacy papers will continue to be printed in black ink, but it's the red ink that will ultimately spell the demise of many of them.

      " Due to extensive poaching in which the perceived value of their horns seems to matter more than their lives, the northern white rhino population has dwindled severely through the years. While many people may consider numbers in the hundreds or even thousands small, in the instance of the northern white rhino, the numbers are much more shocking; they can literally be counted on one hand. Sadly, with the recent natural death of Angalifu, a 44-year-old rhino at San Diego's National Safari Park, there are now only five left on the planet. While it's good news that they're under the protection of zoos and wildlife reserves, the bad news is that it's unlikely that the remaining rhinos will produce offspring, as it's very rare for rhinos to breed in captivity. In fact, the female rhino at the San Diego Park, Nola (who is still living), was unable to produce offspring with Angalifu. (1,2) Furthermore, there is only one male of this species left. Named Sudan, he lives in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Two females, Najin and Fatu, live with him. Elsewhere, there's an elderly female rhino living in the Czech Republic at the Dvur Kralove Zoo. (3) 'Angalifu's death is a tremendous loss to all of us,' said the safari park curator, Randy Rieches. '[N]ot only because he was well beloved here at the park but also because his death brings this wonderful species one step closer to extinction.' (3) Dire need to protect wildlife from extinction The need for such animals to be put in captivity is essential to help save the species. Despite no supporting scientific evidence, many in Asian cultures -- where the horns are in high demand -- believe that the horns harness medicinal powers and that they're a sign of wealth. Their horns, which contain keratin, are considered very valuable on the black market, where an ounce of it can earn someone a quick $5,550, give or take. That figure is estimated to be of more worth than the price of gold or platinum. (4) Unfortunately, though, the poaching has continued, killing them or forcing animals out of their natural habitat. Then situations such as old age takes its toll as it did for Angalifu. Couple natural deaths with the odds of producing offspring, and many feel that complete extinction of this particular rhino is only a matter of time. That is, unless science steps in. Can science and technology step in to help save the rhino and other animals? Efforts have been looked into to help these northern white rhinos reproduce via in vitro fertilization. However, most people are familiar with this taking place among cows, where the process is fairly easy and relatively inexpensive. The story is vastly different with rhinos, where the process is only in the experimental stages. 'You're dealing with a semi-wild, what, 2-ton animal?' said the CEO of Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Richard Vigne. 'Which is very different than dealing with completely domesticated cattle.' Vigne was involved with an effort that airlifted northern white rhinos from a Czech Republic zoo to Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy with the hopes of providing the animals with a more natural habitat that was more conducive to mating. Unfortunately, while a pair was found mating in 2009, no offspring were produced. (2) Instead, there are talks of exploring another avenue which involves extraction of a northern white rhino egg, fertilizing it with frozen northern white rhino sperm, then implanting it in a surrogate womb of the southern white rhino which is a genetically different subspecies. While the northern and southern white rhinos look very similar, the southern has a larger front horn and a difference in terrain preferences from the northern. (2) But what makes this approach more viable, perhaps, is that the southern white rhino has made a comeback; once numbering a mere 20, protection and successful breeding efforts have put their current numbers around 14,000. (2) In the meantime, to help stave off poachers who continue to kill other animals such as black rhino and elephants, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are being eyed as a beneficial wildlife-saving mechanism. The craft, or drones as they're often called, use high-spec night and thermal imaging technologies and can be programmed to hover over wildlife areas to spot would-be poachers in a manner that isn't disruptive to the animals. It's just one of many ways to bring technology into the equation; radio towers that monitor animal tracking tags are also being examined as a means to save wildlife from extinction.

      " The president of the United States has his priorities mixed up. And what's more, he ought to be ashamed of himself. That isn't a Democrat or Republican criticism. It is a statement of fact regarding any American president who would allow illegal aliens the 'right' to protest on a taxpayer-bought-and-paid-for National Mall he ordered closed to American citizens - who also happen to be veterans of World War II - at the risk of being arrested by uniformed Secret Service officers in riot gear. As reported by Breitbart News over the weekend: Secret Service and police in riot gear arrived to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. Sunday to monitor veterans demanding that memorials barricaded due to the government shutdown be re-opened. Though the Obama administration barricaded open-air memorials and even previously threatened to arrest World War II veterans on 'Honor Flights' to see their memorial, they allowed pro-amnesty demonstrators, including many illegal immigrants, to use the National Mall, which was supposed to be closed due to the shutdown, for a rally in support of comprehensive immigration reform. Democrats in Congress - like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi - were allowed to ride to the event in golf carts. For this president, illegal aliens take precedence over World War II veterans Yes, that's right. Democrats like Pelosi - who thanked Obama for allowing the Mall to be opened for the rally - and Vice President Biden have nothing but praise for illegal aliens, but they aren't lifting a finger to ensure access to a memorial for fragile World War II vets who likely won't live long enough to see it again. Not all U.S. political figures and leaders are as misguided and heartless, as reported by Breitbart News : Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who addressed the veterans along with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) at the 'Million Vet March,' said that during what she said should be referred to as the 'government slim-down,' President Obama was showing not only his real priorities but a 'shameful' 'lack of valor' and 'lack of respect.' On her Facebook page , rally attendee LaDonna Hale Curzon from Virginia wrote that, prior to Palin's arrival, there was more shameful behavior on the part of federal officers and local police, who she said moved in and 'attempted to shut down the event.' She also wrote that 'two police cruisers blocked entrance into the WWII memorial, in an effort to stop truckers from arriving from the highway' and 'four marked Secret Service vehicles arrived on the scene, joining dozens of law enforcements, who had already arrived, including a SWAT team dressed in full riot gear.' All across the Internet Monday, pictures of police in riot gear, squad cars and even armored 'riot' vehicles were seen at the event. What the president did is disgraceful, period 'Police blocked the road leading up to the WWII memorial from both directions,' wrote Curzon. 'What a nice way to spend my Sunday morning and to see how our veterans are treated at their own memorial. Last week, the Obama administration opened the mall for immigration activist protest yet blocked WWII vets in wheelchairs to see the WWII memorial. What is happening to our country?!' Later, scores of demonstrators disassembled the metal barricades around the memorial and took them to the White House nearby, where they tossed them in heaps. Regardless of your politics, it says much about the mindset of a president who would seek to punish veterans of the greatest war of the Greatest Generation, over nothing more than petty party politics and ideology. That Obama never served is not the point; that he would ever seek to punish those who have is a disgrace. Sources: http://www.breitbart.com http://weaselzippers.us http://thehill.com \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) Cancer rates are still higher among black Americans compared to their white counterparts, according to recent statistics released by the American Cancer Society. Rates among black men are higher by more than one-third over whites, and the rates for black women are higher by 18 percent. Blacks will represent almost 63,000 of the estimated 560,000 deaths of cancer in 2007, the ACS reports. They also will represent 153,000 of 1.7 million new cancer cases in 2007. 'African Americans have the highest death rate and shortest survival rate of any other racial or ethnic group for most cancers,' according to the ACS web site. Mike Adams, a natural health advocate and published author, accused the medical profession of misinforming the black population about the benefits of sunlight, relating this to the higher prevalence of cancer among blacks. 'Blacks die from skin cancer at rates that far exceed whites because conventional medicine strives to keep black Americans in a state of ignorance concerning the need for sunlight and Vitamin D,' Adams said. 'Since dark skin pigmentation blocks Vitamin D synthesis in the skin, as many as 75 percent of blacks are chronically deficient in the anticancer vitamin. The way to save the lives of millions of black Americans over the next ten years is to tell the truth about sunlight and Vitamin D.' Most forms of cancer are more prevalent in blacks versus whites on an adjusted scale of rate per 100,000 people, however the few exceptions are cancers of the breast, skin, bladder and also leukemia, the report shows. Overall, cancer rates among blacks have decreased overall for the past century. However, lung cancer rates have increased among black women and will be again the number one killer among the combined black population. The report states that this can be associated with the higher prevalence of smoking menthol cigarettes among the black population, which offer a less harsh feel of inhalation to the throat but are possibly more dangerous to the human body than a normal cigarette. In 2003, 27 percent of all cigarette sales were menthols, but around 70 percent of menthol cigarette sales go to blacks. ### \n",
      " Eating a diet high in walnuts may decrease cholesterol and fight inflammation, two major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, according to a study conducted by researchers from Harvard University and published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . 'Consumption of nuts has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease events and death,' the researchers wrote. 'Walnuts in particular have a unique profile: they are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may improve blood lipids and other cardiovascular disease risk factors.' Walnuts are also considered good dietary sources of fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin E and other antioxidants. Researchers analyzed the results of 13 different studies conducted on a total of 365 participants who had obtained between 10 and 24 percent of their calories from walnuts for four to 24 weeks. They found that participants on a high-walnut diet underwent significant decreases in total and LDL ('bad') cholesterol. 'When compared with control diets, diets supplemented with walnuts resulted in a significantly greater decrease in total cholesterol and in LDL-cholesterol concentrations,' the researchers wrote. The researchers also found other indicators that even though a high-walnut diet is high in fat, it seems to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease rather than raising it. 'Other results reported in the trials indicated that walnuts provided significant benefits for certain antioxidant capacity and inflammatory markers and had no adverse effects on body weight,' the researchers wrote. The researchers called for 'larger and longer-term trials' to further understand the heart benefits of nut-rich diets. Prior studies have linked diets high in nuts and berries to a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of symptoms related to cardiovascular disease. Other nuts previously linked to improved cardiovascular health include macadamia nuts and almonds. Diets high in walnuts may also reduce the risk of breast cancer, studies show.

      " He has billed himself as an unbiased arbiter of news and political events as he has hosted the Good Morning, America program for ABC News since leaving his post as the White House Communications Director and campaign advisor for President Bill Clinton. That alone would have once disqualified George Stephanopoulos from being seriously considered a 'journalist' in the normal sense of the word. Times have changed, however, and the legacy news media in America has long since become little more than a revolving door for political hacks on the left and right as they await their next position in a politically friendly administration. For his part, Stephanopoulos hasn't reentered the Democratic political world officially. Nevertheless, it has become more than obvious that he's been working as a Democratic political operative while masquerading as a journalist for ABC News with recent revelations that he has been donating large sums of money to the foundation of his former boss. In a mea culpa to viewers, Stephanopoulos 'admitted' his 'mistake' but tried to couch it as innocently as possible. Little of the money went to charity work 'I made charitable donations to the Foundation in support of the work they're doing on global AIDS prevention and deforestation, causes I care about deeply,' he said. 'I thought that my contributions were a matter of public record. However, in hindsight, I should have taken the extra step of personally disclosing my donations to my employer and to the viewers on air during the recent news stories about the Foundation. I apologize.' As reported by Politico , Stephanopoulos -- who made donations of $25,000 to the Clinton Family Foundation in 2012, 2013 and 2014 -- 'never disclosed this information to viewers, even when interviewing author Peter Schweizer last month about his book 'Clinton Cash,' which alleges that donations to the foundation may have influenced some of Hillary Clinton's actions as secretary of state.' As selfnews has reported and Schweizer has intimated, the foundation is really little more than a slush fund of nearly 200 corporate and foreign donors who were likely less interested in its charitable efforts than in access to a woman who could be the country's next president. If that sounds conspiratorial, consider the fact that of the hundreds of millions donated, just a small percentage of those funds are distributed to its charitable causes. According to the Foundation's own tax filings, just 10 percent of funding went to charities in 2013. Political slush fund As reported by The New York Post , the foundation's finances are so shady that it has been placed on a 'watch list' by a non-partisan organization, Charity Navigator, that monitors such groups after it was revealed that during 2013, the foundation took in $140 million but only spent $9 million on charitable activities. 'The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends,' the Post reported. As for Stephanopoulos' claims that his donations were specifically for 'global AIDS prevention and deforestation,' those don't hold water. There are plenty of organizations out there that he could have donated to directly that specifically deal with those issues. How could he possibly have known that the Clinton Foundation would have used his money directly for 'global AIDS prevention and deforestation?' 'It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,' Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group where progressive Democrat and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout was once an organizing director, told the Post . The function of the Clinton Family Foundation and the nature of its operations and sources of donations -- especially the foreign sources -- became an issue recently as Hillary Clinton prepared to launch her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton had failed to disclose information regarding the donations and their sources while she served as secretary of state in the Obama administration, despite pledging to do so when she took the position .

      " While there has been a lot of research both in favor and against one of America's favorite drinks, this latest bit of research leaves you feeling a little less guilty after having that second, or third, or even fourth cup of coffee. The results of a new study suggest that drinking up to four cups of coffee a day may reduce your risk of developing cancer of the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus, according to researchers. Published in the February issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention , scientists found that drinking roughly 26 to 37 ounces of coffee per day reduced endometrial cancer by up to 18 percent. 'We were not surprised by the results that a high versus low intake of coffee was associated with a reduced risk for endometrial cancer, because they were consistent with what has been observed in previous studies,' said study author Melissa Merritt, who is also a research fellow in cancer epidemiology at Imperial College London in England. Study: Women who drank about four cups of coffee per day were less likely to develop cancer of the endometrium, compared with those who consumed less than one cup a day Researchers reached their results using data on nearly half a million women from two large ongoing studies and studying the dietary habits of more than 2,800 women with cancer of the endometrium. 'We used similar methods to investigate the association between coffee intake and endometrial cancer as previous studies,' said Merritt. 'This is important so we can compare results across different studies.' During the study, researches found that one trial, which included drinking 37 ounces of coffee a day, reduced endometrial cancer risk by 18 percent. Another trial involving consumption of 26 ounces per day identified a similar reduction, reports CBS News . After evaluating 84 foods and nutrients, Merritt's team found that, 'For most other dietary factors, there was no consistent association with endometrial cancer risk.' It's important to note that, while researchers did identify a link, they did not find a cause-and-effect relationship between coffee drinking and lower risk of endometrial cancer. Scientists also did not differentiate between drinking decaf or regular coffee; therefore, Merritt said she couldn't comment on which one is better. Dr. Robert Morgan, a professor of medical oncology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the new study is 'validating other studies showing coffee has a beneficial effect in decreasing endometrial cancer .' Antioxidants found in coffee may prevent or slow cell damage While researchers aren't entirely sure why coffee may help lower the risk of endometrial cancer, Merritt suggests that one reason might be because coffee reduces estrogen levels in the body, changing the balance of hormones. The risk of endometrial cancer increases when the balance between estrogen and progesterone shifts and leans more towards estrogen, according to the American Cancer Society. Being overweight, beginning menstruation earlier than normal and late menopause may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Other risk factors include having an inherited form of colorectal cancer, never being pregnant or being infertile, and using tamoxifen to prevent or treat breast cancer. Tamoxifen is a hormone therapy drug that blocks the actions of estrogen. Endometrial cancer claims more than 10,000 lives each year in the United States In the U.S., cancer of the endometrium is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs, according to Cancer.org . Roughly 54,000 cases are expected to be diagnosed this year, with more than 10,000 of them likely to be fatal. This type of cancer is more common among women over 45 years old, with about three out of four cases being diagnosed in women ages 55 and older.

      " Tweet The epilepsy drug valproate poses a higher risk for fetal death and birth defects than other commonly used epilepsy drugs, according to a study published in the August 8, 2006, issue of Neurology, the scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Of the four epilepsy drugs tested in the study, valproate posed the highest risk to the fetus with over 20 percent of the pregnancies exposed to valproate resulting in death or birth defects such as skull and limb deformities and brain, heart and lung problems. The rate was lower for the drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine and lamotrigine. The study's findings are consistent with several other recent studies. 'The evidence is compelling that valproate poses a higher risk of birth defects than other commonly used epilepsy drugs,' said study author Kimford Meador, MD, of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida and a fellow at the American Academy of Neurology. 'Unfortunately, many doctors and pregnant women aren't aware of the risks.' The study examined 333 pairs of mother and child in the United States and the United Kingdom. Meador is recommending doctors talk with their patients about the risks associated with valproate when choosing an epilepsy drug for women of child-bearing age. Patients already taking valproate should also be advised of the risk. 'Although valproate will continue to be an important treatment option in women who aren't able to use other epilepsy drugs, we're advising valproate not be used as the drug of first choice for women of child bearing potential, and when used, its dosage should be limited if possible,' said Meador.

      " A volunteer patient has developed cancer after participating in a London drug study that ended in disaster and outrage, and left the healthcare system in shock. Earlier this year healthy, paid volunteers became the test subjects for a new drug made to treat leukemia and chronic inflammation. Two were given harmless placebos, while the other six volunteers were given the drug, which was in its first phase of human testing. All six patients reported tragic side effects, and a few nearly died. Several weeks ago one volunteer, David Oakley, tested positive for the early stages of cancer. Strange cells had shown up in his blood tests, which doctors confirmed as signs of the disease. They say since it was caught so early, the cancer is treatable. 'I can't dwell on it because if I dwell on it I'm just going to go down in a heap,' Oakley said of his struggle to remain positive. Other volunteers experienced side effects that posed serious health risks; the neck of one patient increased to three times its normal size, while another patient's head grew to the size of his waist. Oakley believes the drug company Paraxel should be held accountable for their wrongdoing. Paraxel denies any wrongdoing and insist their practices met legal requirements, although investigation by British regulatory agencies found that procedures were not followed properly. ### \n",
      " It's one of the few victories for the people against an out-of-control federal agency that is growing more lawless and arrogant by the year. As reported by Indian Country Today , the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Department of the Interior (as does the Bureau of Indian Affairs), was forced to cancel an oil and gas lease in the Badger-Two Medicine region in northwestern Montana earlier this month, thereby keeping land that is culturally and traditionally sacred to members of the Blackfoot Nation pristine. 'It's a very historic day for the Blackfeet,' said John Murray, the Blackfeet Nation's Historic Preservation Officer, Indian Country Today reported. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, in a statement announcing the decision, said that it was the correct action to take on behalf of the tribe and its future members. 'Today's action honors Badger-Two Medicine's rich cultural and natural resources and recognizes the irreparable impacts that oil and gas development would have on them,' Jewell said. Decision ends all legal wrangling Indian Country Today reported further: The 130,000-acre Badger-Two Medicine region, part of the Lewis and Clark National Forest, is wedged between Glacier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The area is historically, culturally and spiritually significant to the Blackfeet Tribe and is part of a recognized Traditional Cultural District, characteristics that caused Congress to legislatively withdraw the area from mineral development in 2006. 'It's not a wilderness,' said Murray. 'It is a living Blackfeet landscape.' The BLM had issued a 6,200-acre oil and gas lease to Solenex, of Louisiana, under then-Interior Secretary James Watt in 1982, but operations have been in limbo since 1985. BLM since determined that the lease was not properly issued because it violated the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historical Preservation Act, the department said. Jewell's decision came after carefully examining the record and following consultations with the U.S. Forest Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the Blackfeet tribe, the lease-holding company and other concerned parties. A number of ethnographic studies and one archeological study have been done on the tract of land . The BLM decision ends legal attempts by the Mountain States Legal Foundation, which was litigating on behalf of Solenex in challenging the Interior Department's Nov. 23 decision to cancel the lease. Every single one of the originally issued leases to the region have undergone a plethora of administrative, legal and legislative actions since they were handed down more than three decades ago due to the significance of the Badger-Two Medicine region and over concerns about circumstances that led to the lease issuance. Refreshing change Indian Country reported that some two-thirds of original leaseholders took advantage of tax incentives that Congress established in exchange for voluntarily relinquishing leases to the region. 'There was only one lease that was subject to the court, but overall there are 18 leases,' Murray said. 'We are hopeful that the rest of them are going to be canceled also.' The BLM has been at the center of various controversies in recent years, more so than in the past. As NewsTarget.com reported earlier this month, the agency that most Americans never heard of made the news when about 200 armed agents in SWAT gear surrounded a Nevada rancher named Cliven Bundy in April 2014 with automatic weapons, helicopters and government snipers. Then in January, a group of armed men led by Ammon Bundy, Cliven Bundy's son, took over a small building on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge to protest terroristic actions taken by the BLM against Western ranchers. As further reported by The Daily Sheeple , BLM agents were caught on video setting fires that became uncontrolled and were left to burn unmonitored around Prince Glenn, Oregon, (not very different from what another ranch family, the Hammonds, were jailed for burning government land). So, to see people actually win a legal battle against BLM and the Interior Department is a refreshing change. Sources: IndianCountryTodayMediaNetwork.com DOJ.gov NewsTarget.com \n",
      " Tweet New research released today at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology's Annual Meeting found that older Americans may improve their memory by making simple lifestyle changes including memory exercises, physical fitness, healthy eating and stress reduction. The study was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and funded by the Fran and Ray Stark Foundation Fund for Alzheimer's Disease Research, the Judith Olenick Elgart Fund for Research on Brain Aging, and the Parlow-Solomon Professorship on Aging. 'We've known for years that diet and exercise can help people maintain their physical health, which is a key component of healthy aging,' says lead investigator, Gary Small, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, ' But maintaining mental health is just as important. Now we have evidence which suggests that people can preserve their memory by adding memory exercises and stress reduction to this routine.' The study was the first to test the impact of combining memory exercises and stress reduction with a healthy diet and exercise to improve memory. In the 14-day study, subjects with normal baseline memory performance scores were randomly assigned to two groups (sample size of 17 individuals). In the test group, subjects following a memory improvement plan which included: Memory Training Brainteasers, crossword puzzles and memory exercises, which emphasized verbal skills, were conducted throughout the day to stimulate the brain. Healthy Diet Participants ate five meals daily, which included a balanced diet rich in omega-3 fats, low-glycemic index carbohydrates (e.g., whole grains) and antioxidants. Eating five small meals throughout the day prevents dips in blood glucose levels and glucose is the primary energy source for the brain. Physical Fitness Brisk daily walks and stretching were done daily to promote physical fitness, which has been found to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's Disease. Stress Reduction Participants used stretching and relaxation exercises to manage stress. Stress causes the body to release cortisol, which plays an important role in memory preservation. Cortisol can impair memory and has been found to shrink the memory centers in the brain. In the control group, subjects did not make any behavior modifications. Immediately before and after the 14-day study, each participant's brain function was tested using positron emission tomorgraphy (PET) scans to measure activity throughout the brain. After the 14-day study, participants following the memory improvement plan recorded a 5% decrease in brain metabolism in the dorsal lateral prefrontal region of the brain, which is directly linked to working memory and other cognitive functions, suggesting that they were using their brain more efficiently. Furthermore, these subjects reported improved memory, and demonstrated better performance on a cognitive measure controlled by this same brain region. 'Most people do not realize that they are in control of their memory as they get older,' declared Dr. Small, 'But this research demonstrates that it is possible, in just 14 days, to make simple lifestyle changes that will not only improve memory and brain function, but also will improve overall health and wellness.' The next step in this research is to better understand the specific effect of each individual component of the memory improvement plan to determine which combination of healthy lifestyle strategies produces optimal results.

      " While the Central Intelligence Agency has a history of paying off petty tyrants and thugs in its quest to keep America safe, no regular federal agency would purposely seek out and hire the dregs of society. Right ? Wrong. Enter the illustrious Transportation Security Administration . Are you surprised? According to 'Rob,' a TSA supervisor-turned-whistleblower, in an interview with the Alex Jones Show , the agency's brass is directing staff to hire degenerates - people with criminal records who have exhibited violent tendencies and psychopathic behavior. How do you like air travel now? During the interview, Rob talked about his job, which entailed filing reports on TSA screeners who did not follow agency procedures. He said he was alarmed by the fact that the agency was hiring a number of criminals who he said exhibited the behavior of 'psychopaths.' 'We have a program in the state of Rhode Island where we take prisoners who are out for non-violent drug offenses and everything else - basically sociopaths - and we're sending them to a ten-day course and getting them in uniform checking out people,' the whistleblower said. He noted that people who presented themselves very professionally were often passed over in favor of applicants who had spent time in jail and who had megalomaniacal, power-trip tendencies. The aberrancy is getting noticed 'If they have a background and it's something like violence or abusing authority we put them right in, we put them guys on the floor first day,' said Rob, who also said he was encouraged to hire veterans from the Iraq war who had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 'It's all about the power trip, it's all about having people bug their eyes out at the public and getting the public conditioned to the fact that the police state is coming,' Rob said, adding that TSA screeners were instructed to stick out their chests in arrogance and 'eyeball people.' The TSA's bizarre behavior, as well as the agency's lower-than-low hiring standards, is getting noticed by more and more people. Fortunately for all Americans, an increasing number of those are people who can do something about it (let's hope they do). Take a recent report about the TSA by U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. In it she highlighted the fact that TSA agents engage in criminal behavior so often it's almost routine. She says that's no aberrancy, it's because of 'TSA's hiring practices and insufficient use of background checks.' 'This report details highly disturbing cases where pedophiles and child pornographers wearing federal law enforcement uniforms are not only patting down unsuspecting travelers, but in many cases stealing valuables from their bags,' she told a local news station in early June. 'Enough is enough. It's time for Congress to step in and demand accountability from Administrator [John] Pistole.' But what should Americans expect? Criminal risk-based organization? The TSA's recruitment policy does not reflect its own mantra, which is that it was created as an 'intelligent risk-based organization.' The agency doesn't conduct criminal and background checks on many of its employees, Blackburn's report noted, and that it trolls for employees by advertising 'for employment at the Washington Reagan National Airport on pizza boxes and on advertisements above pumps at discount gas stations in the D.C. area.' Rob also told Alex Jones that TSA screeners were being ordered by supervisors to check bags of people who were only coming to the airport to pick up a traveler. He said he was once directed to search a diaper bag that belonged to a woman who had only come to the airport to pick up her husband. A little much? 'We're doing patrols in the parking lot with dogs, we're even going as far out to the train station because the train station is connected to the airport here and we have guys walking around the train station, walking around the rental cars, we're inspecting cars coming into the parking garage, I mean we've fully expanded - we're no longer just at the gate and just at the security checkpoint,' he said, adding that supervisors were firing agents who refused to grope travelers in certain areas. Rob, the report noted, was contacted by his bosses shortly after the interview and reprimanded, by the way. Sources: http://www.infowars.com http://www.prisonplanet.com www.selfnews.com/TSA.html \n",
      " Residents of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, have complained about a state program to spread sewage sludge on public lands near their homes, citing health concerns. The treated sewage sludge, formally known as 'biosolids,' is intended to enrich the soil and help vegetation regrow on the site of a former strip mine that has been turned into a state game reserve. A New York waste management company has received a permit to dispose of biosolids on 50 acres of Pennsylvania state land without paying any disposal fee. Local residents such as Brian Gould, 30, who recently built a house on property abutting the game lands, have expressed concerns about the health effects of spreading treated sewage next to their homes. 'Whenever they spread it, the valley fills in with a fog,' Gould said. 'We're at the highest point around. The wind is always blowing. Whatever they spread up here is going to be carried all around.' 'It smells like if you took 40 Porta-Johns and kicked them over in July,' he said. 'And that's being nice.' Gould's wife, Allison, recently told game officials that, when the spreading began, she was hospitalized with bronchial spasms, which feel like a heart attack. The doctor told her that such spasms can be triggered by airborne pollutants. 'I'm 27. I've never had asthma or any respiratory problems,' she said. 'But that night, I had an elephant sitting on my chest. ... What is this stuff going to do to our families, to our kids?' Residents confront game officials At a recent town meeting, roughly 100 residents confronted officials of the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which is responsible for the program. 'The people here pay your wages, and we don't want it,' shouted Bell Township Supervisor Dave Kauffman. 'Pull the permits!' Although state Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Daniel Spadoni assured residents that the biosolids site has been inspected five times with no violations found, residents said that they have been suffering from chronic headaches and nausea. 'It can't be good for you,' said Ryan Smith, 32. 'I mean, it smells like dead animals. You can sit in our living room and feel like you're eating it.' Many residents , including the Goulds, are testing their water to establish a baseline against future contamination, and Mahaffey Fire Chief Dan Wright announced at the meeting that he will refuse to dispatch firefighters to any fires that break out too close to the sludge. 'You can't guarantee it's safe, so I won't send them in,' he said, standing and jabbing his finger at the game officials. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows for the application of treated sewage sludge as fertilizer, environmental groups such as the Sierra Club warn that biosolids may contain pollutants and disease-causing contaminants that can cause both short- and long-term harm to humans, animals and the environment. For example, contaminants could leach into nearby wells and groundwater. 'Biosolids is a euphemism for sewage sludge,' said Tom Richard, director of Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment. 'Before we started spreading them on our land, we used to put them in landfills and dump them in the ocean. That didn't work out so well, because some of it would wash up on the shores of New Jersey, and people didn't like that.' Richard noted that, while EPA tests have indicated that the health risks from biosolids are 'low,' it would be deceptive to claim that biosolids are completely safe. 'Unfortunately low is not zero,' he said. 'It's not zero risk for all the things they've tested, for heavy metals, pathogens, etc. Anyone who tells you it's zero risk doesn't understand the way the risk analysis was conducted.' \n",
      " On January 17, 1995, an article written by Beatrice Dexter about the benefits of honey and cinnamon powder, appeared in The Weekly World News. Please allow me to preface this article with a bit of information unbeknown to the writer and virtually everyone else: cinnamon is 26 percent sulfur based and honey is 33 percent sulfur based, making their combination 59 percent sulfur based and the reason why their combination is so effective. Honey is the only food on the planet that will not spoil or rot. Honey will crystallize if it is left in a cool dark place for the long time, but do not mistake this crystallization for it turning into sugar. Honey never will become sugar. If it does crystallize, simply loosen the lid and let the honey jar sit in boiled water, as this will allow the honey to re-liquefy naturally. It is important to note that you do not put a honey jar in boiling water while still be heated or in a microwave as these will kill the enzymes in the honey. Obviously, you will never read about this in the mainstream media because they are hookers for BigPharma and could interfere with their drug pushing profits if too many people learned about the effectiveness of sulfur-based remedies. Today's science says that even though honey is sweet and when taken in the right dosage as a 'medicine', it will not and does not harm even diabetics. Ok, all that being said, let's get to healing qualities of the sulfur-based cinnamon/honey combination as researched by Western scientists, who by the way, are clueless about the sulfur effectiveness or the fact that cinnamon and honey are sulfur based: HEART DISEASE Make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder and apply it on bread instead of jelly and jam and eat it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and could prevent a heart attack. If someone already had a heart attack and you take this combination, your next heart attack may never happen. The regular use of this combination relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heartbeat. In America and Canada, various nursing homes have treated patients successfully and have found that as one ages, the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; the cinnamon and honey combination revitalizes the arteries and veins. ARTHRITIS Arthritis patients should take, twice a day (morning and night), a cup of hot water with two tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. When taken regularly, even chronic arthritis can be cured. In a research project conducted at Copenhagen University, it was found that when doctors treated their patients with a mixture of one tablespoon of honey and a half-teaspoon of cinnamon powder before breakfast, they found that within a week 73 out of the 200 tested were totally relieved of pain. Within a month, most all of the people who had trouble walking or moving around because of their arthritis could walk without pain. BLADDER INFECTIONS Take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It will destroy the germs in the bladder. CHOLESTEROL Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of water were found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10 percent within two hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, when taken three times a day, chronic cholesterol is cured. The scientists also found that pure honey taken with food on a daily basis relieves complaints of cholesterol. COLDS Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon of lukewarm honey with one quarter of a spoonful for cinnamon powder daily for three days as this procedure will cure most chronic coughs, colds, and will clear the sinuses. UPSET STOMACH Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers for its roots. GAS According to the studies done in India and Japan, it is revealed that when honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas. IMMUNE SYSTEM Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacterial and viral attacks. The scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in larger amounts. Constant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles, where the DNA is contained, to fight bacterial and viral diseases. INDIGESTION Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food is eaten relieves acidity and aids in the digestion of the heaviest of meals. INFLUENZA A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural 'ingredient', which kills the flu germs and will prevent the person from getting the flu. (I ain't no learned scientist but I do know that the natural 'ingredient' is sulfur and that those that take the organic sulfur crystals never get the flu). LONGEVITY Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly, arrests the ravages of old age. Use four teaspoons of honey, one teaspoon of cinnamon powder, and three cups of boiling water to make the tea. Drink one quarter of a cup three to four times a day. It keeps the skin fresh and soft and delays aging. Life spans increase and even those in their 90s plus, will have the energy of someone half their age. Allow me to inject some humor here: I play in two senior softball leagues. One of the guys, who is 87 asks me if the sulfur crystals are good for erectile dysfunction. I tell him that they are but they must be taken twice a day. About two weeks later I ask him if he is taking the crystals. He says he is. I then ask him if he is taking them twice a day. He says he is taking them once a day. I reminded him that their utmost effectiveness is by taking them twice a day. He says that he knows that but his wife can't handle it when he takes them twice a day. RASPY OR SORE THROAT When the throat has a tickle or is raspy, take one tablespoon of honey and sip it until it is finished. Repeat this every three hours until the throat is without symptoms. PIMPLES Three tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon power paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it off the next morning with warm water. When done for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root (of course, eliminating sugar from the diet couldn't hurt). SKIN INFECTIONS Applying honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts to cure eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections. WEIGHT LOSS In the morning and one half hour before breakfast and on an empty stomach, and at night before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one cup of water. When taken regularly, it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. Also, drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet. CANCER Recent research in Japan and Australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon power three times a day for one month. FATIGUE Recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior citizens who take honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts are more alert and flexible. A Dr. Milton, who apparently does not have a first name, has done research showing that a half tablespoon of honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, even when the vitality of the body starts to decrease, when taken daily after brushing and in the afternoon at about 3:00 P.M., the vitality of the body increases within a week. BAD BREATH Gargling with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water first thing in the morning will keep the breath fresh all day. HEARING LOSS Allegedly, daily morning and night honey and cinnamon powder, taken in equal parts restores hearing. TOOTHACHE Make a paste of one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and apply it to the aching tooth three times a day until the ache is gone. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure and its accompanying symptoms of chest pain and dizziness disappeared in many patients' just weeks after an Italian researcher gave them regular doses of honey and cinnamon. Blood pressure improved and all 137 subjects felt better after a few weeks. REGARDING CINNAMON The cinnamon powder that you get in the super markets could very well be sawdust that has been colored and artificially flavored. I think it is better to get the bark and powder it yourself or but it from a reputable natural food store. Most spices are irradiated. This is supposedly done to eradicate bacteria, but spices are generally excellent bactericides so the irradiation is merely a way of destroying the precious properties of spices. Non-irradiated spices are available from most high-end health foods stores. Cinnamon can be confused for cassia and in fact many powdered forms use cassia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassia ). It is also known as 'bastard cinnamon'. True cinnamon is also known as 'Ceylon' cinnamon. There are other variants such as Indonesian and Vietnamese so avoid anything that is from these countries. Specifically ask for Ceylon Cinnamon. Cinnamomum zeylanicum is the botanical name for the purest and most potent form of cinnamon. Not long ago I wrote an article for selfnews on the 21 Reasons To Try Organic Sulfur Crystals. See if you notice the similarities in benefits. 1. Organic sulfur is not a drug or prescription medicine, but rather a nutrient that the body is deprived of. 2. It increases enzyme production within the glands of the body, substantially increasing resistance to illness. 3. It increases flexibility in the tissues within the body and increases blood circulation. 4. It reduces muscle and joint inflammation, promotes healing in the muscles and joints and prevents them from becoming sore. To the degree there is soreness, recovery and return to normality is quickened. Athletes, in particular, benefit from this as the intake of OS dramatically increases their recovery time. 5. It eliminates 'free radicals' in the body. Allergies to pollens ad certain foods can be eliminated or reduced by its use. 6. It promotes healthy, increased growth of hair and fingernails. 7. Because of the oxygenation of the cells and tissues that the OS facilitates, the body is kept in a constant aerobic environment making it so that cancer cells cannot survive or exist. 8. Studies have shown it can help reverse symptoms of osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 9. It aids in healthy skin production and the reduction of 'wrinkles'. It is one of the main ingredients in moisturizing creams. 10. It helps the body properly regulate insulin production. Adequate OS in the diet may reduce the amount of insulin injections. 11. It helps alleviate chronic headaches and migraines. Increased circulation in the brain cells promotes proper blood circulation within the brain. Less pressure and pain result, reducing tendencies for headaches. 12. It helps alleviate emphysema by providing the body with material to manufacture new, healthy cells on lung walls. 13. Because of the ability to make cell walls more permeable. OS causes the body to rapidly release and reduce alcohol 'hangover' toxins, removing them as waste from the body. The process quickens recovery time from a 'hangover', often as quickly as 20 minutes. 14. It helps in reducing and often eliminating diverticulitis. Parasites living in the intestines are unable to remain attached to the walls due to the slippery coating that the OS produces. Because of this, hatching parasitic worms are flushed out as well because they cannot attach to the walls. 15. It reduces hypoglycemia in the body because it has made it easier for the body to introduce blood sugar through more permeable cell walls. Less insulin is demanded for the process, resulting in less overuse of the pancreas. Within several months of constant usage, OS can reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia entirely. 16. It helps alleviate PMS. Glandular production is enhanced by OS to have more 'normal' levels of production. Acid, enzyme, and hormonal levels are more evenly balanced facilitating reduction of cramps, headaches, and nausea associated with the monthly cycle. 17. It helps promote better kidney function more efficiently. Water retention problems associated with poor kidney function can be alleviated. 18. It can help alleviate eye problems. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of the sulfur crystals in 4 ounces of water and use as eye drops as frequently as you like. 19. OS delivers the essential omega-3 throughout the body and also allows the body to produce vitamin B-12. 20. It has amazingly reversed countless cases of asthma and 18 cases of autism that we know about so far. 21. Last and certainly not least, it eliminates the continued need for Viagra or Cialis by reversing erectile dysfunction. This is by far the ONLY substance that can remove the poisons from pesticides, heavy metals, radiation, and other toxins.

About the author: I have been doing a weekly radio show in Honolulu since 1981 called 'Health Talk'. In 2007 I was 'forced' to get a Masters degree in Nutrition because of all the doctors that would call in asking for my credentials. They do not call in anymore. Going to www.healthtalkhawaii.com enables you, among other things, to listen to the shows. I am an activist. In addition to espousing an organic vegan diet for optimum health, I am strongly opposed to GMOs, vaccines, processed foods, MSG, aspartame, fluoridation and everything else that the pimps (Big Pharma, Monsanto and the large food companies) and the hookers (the doctors, the government agencies, the public health officials, and the mainstream media) thrust upon us, the tricks. After being vaccinated with the DTP vaccine as a child I developed asthma. After taking the organic sulfur crystals (they are harvested from the pine trees in Louisiana) in November of 2008 for 10 days my asthma reversed and has not come back over 4 years later, 18 cases, so far, of autism have been reversed, as has cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis, joint pain, astigmatism, gum disease, increased sexual activity, heavy metal and radiation elimination, parasite elimination, free radicals elimination, faster athletic recovery time, increased blood circulation, reduced inflammation, resistance to getting the flu, reduction of wrinkles, allergy reduction, reduced PMS and monthly period pain, nausea, migraines and so much more. And it's only possible because of the oxygen it releases that floods the cells of the body. The sulfur, as proven by the University of Southampton in England, enables the body to produce vitamin B12 and the essential amino acids.

      " Prior to the current budgetary sequestration, President Barack Obama went on the record publicly warning Americans of dire consequences should the planned cuts that he himself helped devise - and eventually signed into law - be allowed to go into effect. 'This work, along with hundreds of thousands of jobs, are currently in jeopardy because of politics in Washington. In a few days, Congress might allow a series of immediate, painful, arbitrary budget cuts to take place, known in Washington as the sequester,' he said Feb. 19 at a shipyard in Newport News, Va. 'These cuts are wrong. They're not smart, they're not fair.' Continuing, Obama predicted more dire consequences: If the sequester goes into effect, more than 2,000 college students would lose their financial aid. Across the country these cuts will force federal prosecutors to close cases and potentially let criminals go. Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks and that could cause delays at airports across the country. The president also warned that the cuts would lead to furloughs of 800,000 federal defense workers , as well as layoffs of local first responders, police and firefighters (all of whom, by the way, are paid with local funds , but I digress). Self-fulfilling prophecy? After the March 1 deadline passed and the sequestered cuts became mandatory, Obama eased off his dire warnings, though with far less fanfare, admitting that the cuts would not be as devastating as he claimed they would be. 'We will get through this. This is not going to be an apocalypse, I think as some people have said,' he said, following a nearly hour-long meeting with lawmakers March 1. As you have read, 'some people' who have said the sequester was going to be apocalyptic includes, of course, the president . Apparently, however, Obama is set to make his initial claims that the sequester would be painful on Americans a self-fulfilling prophesy, according to government emails that have been publicized by the Washington Times : The Obama administration denied an appeal for flexibility in lessening the sequester's effects, with an email this week appearing to show officials in Washington that because they already had promised the cuts would be devastating, they now have to follow through on that. In the email sent Monday by Charles Brown, an official with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service office in Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Brown asked 'if there was any latitude' in how to spread the sequester cuts across the region to lessen the impacts on fish inspections. The answer from the White House, quite simply, was... no . 'The Obama administration is doing everything it can...' 'We have gone on record with a notification to Congress and whoever else that 'APHIS would eliminate assistance to producers in 24 states in managing wildlife damage to the aquaculture industry, unless they provide funding to cover the costs.' So it is our opinion that however you manage that reduction, you need to make sure you are not contradicting what we said the impact would be.' In other words, agency officials are being told by the president - who is head of the Executive Branch and directly oversees the vast array of government agencies - to make pain so he can blame it on the sequester and, by default, the opposition party. 'This email confirms what many Americans have suspected: The Obama administration is doing everything they can to make sure their worst predictions come true and to maximize the pain of the Sequester cuts for political gain,' said Rep. Tim Griffin, a Republican lawmaker from Arkansas. APHIS is an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and on March 5, during a congressional hearing, agency head Tom Vilsack said he hadn't seen the email Brown referenced. 'If we have flexibility, we're going to try to use it to make sure we use sequester in the most equitable and least disruptive way,' Vilsack said in response to a question from Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D. 'There are some circumstances, and we've talked a lot about the meat inspection, where we do not have that flexibility because there are so few accounts.' Noem said the email made it sound as if the administration was attempting to use the sequester for political gain. 'I'm hopeful that isn't an agenda that's been put forward,' she said.

      " A quarter of British young adults walk 'only when necessary,' resulting in less than 5 minutes of activity per day, according to a new study by health insurance company Bupa. The survey, conducted on 2,000 British adults, focused on young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. The researchers found that, although the British Heart Foundation recommends a minimum of 30 minutes per day spent walking, the average woman walked only 12 minutes per day, and the average man walked only 8 minutes. 15 percent of adults decided to walk somewhere but gave up partway through (switching to public transportation) at least once a week. Parents aged 42 to 54 largely attributed their children's sedentism to new technology, such as smart phones and social media, and said that they had walked more at the same age. The young adults themselves, however, had different explanations. The most common excuse given for not walking was 'I don't have anyone to walk with.' Women typically cited poor weather or fatigue, while men typically blamed lack of time or a busy schedule. Among adults in general, the most common excuses were weather (31 percent), lack of time (26 percent), lack of fitness (12 percent), not feeling safe (11 percent) and feeling too tired (11 percent). 'It's so easy to make numerous excuses but there are many health benefits to walking,' said Bupa's UK Medical Director, Paula Franklin. 'For most people it is the most accessible form of physical activity, which is also free and can be great fun. Serious health risks The findings are of particular concern given the risks of sedentism on the one hand and the fact that people are neglecting such an easy form of exercise on the other. 'Walking can usually fit easily into your daily routine and something as simple as choosing to walk even part of the way to work instead of taking the car or bus can have a huge impact on your health,' Franklin said. 'For example, adding just 20 minutes walking to your day can dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease and strokes.' In addition to obesity and heart disease, a sedentary lifestyle has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes and spinal problems. As people become less active, doctors are increasingly seeing these diseases in a younger demographic. Stating that the most common type of diabetes - type 2 diabetes - is primarily caused by obesity, he said, 'We are finding more young people aged between 25-30 years getting diabetes as compared to the earlier trend of adults aged between 45-50 developing the illness,' said physician Rejesh Naik, a member of the Indian Medical Association. Another Indian doctor, Preeti Doshi, who runs the pain clinic at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, also blamed sedentism for health problems striking earlier in life. 'Sedentary lifestyle , desk jobs, no exercise and poor posture attribute to spinal problem[s] which [are] affecting the age group of 35-55 the most,' he said. A childhood problem? Although the Bupa study focused on young adults, a recent study of Scottish children found that children are now becoming sedentary even as toddlers, debunking the idea that children are 'naturally' or spontaneously more active than adults. Indeed, the researchers found that the total energy expenditure, physical activity and sedentary behaviors of 78 three-year-olds were equivalent to those of sedentary or only lightly active adults. The children were still largely sedentary two years later. On average, they were expending 200 fewer calories than recommended each day, thereby starting on the path to obesity.

      " Tweet Obesity in a patient is an independent predictor of whether localized prostate cancer will progress following radiotherapy treatment, say researchers at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. In a study reported in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal Cancer, researchers found that moderately and severely obese patients had a 99 percent greater risk of developing biochemical failure (an early marker of cancer progression) than other patients. The study also reports that obese patients had a 66 percent increased risk of having a tumor that recurs or becomes metastatic than did non-obese patients. This finding mirrors results from a parallel study by M. D. Anderson researchers, reported last year in Clinical Cancer Research, that found that a history of weight gain or obesity at the time of diagnosis also played a role in how aggressive prostate cancer may become after surgery. 'Together, these studies confirm that a man's body mass index (BMI = weight/height2) can be a significant factor in how well he fares after standard treatments for prostate cancer,' says the lead researcher of both studies, Sara Strom, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology. 'The fact that the same association was found among patients with different risk profiles, and who were treated with different therapies, would suggest that poorer outcomes in obese men are not related to differences in treatment as much as to differences in tumor behavior between obese and non-obese men,' she says. Strom adds that these findings suggest that obese prostate cancer patients should be followed more closely after treatment. 'When patients and their physicians are uncertain about the need for further therapy, our research indicates that a man's weight should be factored into that decision,' she says. According to Strom, the study is the first to examine the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer progression after primary therapy with external beam radiotherapy, a common treatment option. The researchers sought to determine whether obesity is an independent predictor of biochemical failure - a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level that can indicate advancing cancer - and they also wanted to know if the cancer actually progressed among those patients. To conduct the study, the scientists examined the records of 873 patients whose prostate cancer was locally confined, and who were treated with radiotherapy at M. D. Anderson between 1988 and 2001. Of these patients, 18 percent were mildly obese and 5 percent were moderately to severely obese. They found that patients who were obese tended to be diagnosed with prostate cancer at an earlier age than patients who were not obese, and also that African-American men had the highest obesity rates. After an average follow-up period of 96 months, 295 patients experienced biochemical failure, and cancer recurred in 127 of these patients. After adjusting for clinical and treatment variables among patients, the researchers found that BMI significantly predicted whether a patient would experience both rising PSA and a return of prostate cancer. For example, biochemical failure occured more quickly with increased BMI: an average of 30 months for patients with normal weight, and 26 months for patients deemed moderately to severely obese. Researchers also found that when comparing obese patients with non-obese patients, obese men had a significantly higher rate of cancer recurrence. Strom and her colleagues cannot yet say why excess BMI contributed to cancer progression, or whether losing weight after a prostate cancer diagnosis will make any difference in outcome. 'But by knowing this association, we may be able to design rational preventive strategies,' she says. \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by breast-feeding, even if they have their first child later in life, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Los Angeles. Researchers analyzed data on women who had participated in the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study, the results of which were published in 2003. In the current study, researchers looked at the data for women over the age of 54, 995 of whom had breast cancer and 1,498 of whom did not. They compared the women's risk of acquiring breast cancer with their history of breastfeeding and their age at first birth. There are 200,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States every year, and it is the third most common cause of cancer death in the country. There are two main types of breast tumors: those that contain hormone receptors, and those that do not. Researchers have previously found that having a first child after the age of 25 increases a woman's chance of acquiring hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Among women who have their first child before the age of 25, those who have many children have an even lower breast cancer risk. In the current study, researchers found that breastfeeding decreased a woman's risk for both receptor-positive and receptor-negative cancers, regardless of the age at which she had her first child. 'As more women may choose to delay pregnancy until after 25, it is important to note that breastfeeding provides protection against both estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and negative tumors,' said Giske Ursin, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.' 'Breastfeeding may have a protective effect that negates the increased risk of breast cancer associated with late pregnancies,' Ursin said. \n",
      " Three Namibian women have filed a lawsuit against the country's government, claiming they were sterilized at state-run hospitals without their informed consent after being diagnosed with HIV. 'HIV-positive women are holding the health system accountable for the wrongs done to them,' said Veronica Kalambi of the Women's Health Network. The plaintiffs are represented by the Legal Assistance Center, which says it has collected evidence of 15 such forced sterilizations since 2008. The three women are seeking one million Namibian dollars (U.S. $130,000) in damages. 'We want a health system based on human rights which promotes equality for all,' said Amon Ngavetene of the Legal Assistance Center. According to Ngavetene, women in Namibia who are diagnosed with HIV are often urged by their doctors to undergo sterilization operations. The women are not always given a clear explanation of the risks and consequences of the procedure, nor of the alternatives available (such as drugs) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. In addition, doctors do not always take into account pre-existing conditions that might make the sterilization more dangerous. All these problems are exacerbated by communication barriers in a country with 11 indigenous languages. Hundreds of people marched in support of the women in the Namibian capital of Windhoek, as well as in South Africa, Zambia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Supporters also held sit-ins at two of the hospitals accused of performing the procedures. According to protest organizer Vicky Noa, women deserve 'peace of mind that if you have HIV you can still go to the hospital and be treated with dignity and equality.' 'If we were scared that we might be sterilized, we will not use the hospital services as much,' she said. 'We do not want to be denied the right to motherhood.' According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS, one in five Namibians, or 200,000 people, have been diagnosed as HIV positive.

      " Great white sharks, formerly thought to have a maximum lifespan of about 20 years, can actually live as long as human beings, according to a new study that may have serious implications for ocean conservation. The study was led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and published in the journal PLOS ONE . 'White sharks in the northwest Atlantic are considerably older than previous age estimates,' researcher Li Ling Hamady said. Great white sharks are among the ocean's top predators. Although they are most common in temperate and subtropical waters, they migrate over vast distances and can be found in almost any part of the ocean. Nuclear tests provide key The most common method for estimating age in fish involves counting layers of mineralized tissue in certain body parts that grow consistently throughout the animal's life. Much like tree rings, the number of bands present can indicate an animal's age. Previous studies, assuming that shark growth bands are deposited annually, have pegged the oldest great white sharks at 22 and 23 years of age, identified in the southwestern Pacific and western Indian oceans, respectively. But the assumption that growth bands are deposited annually - or even that their rate of deposition is consistent throughout life - has remained untested. In addition, the banding patterns in great white sharks tend to be narrower and less distinct than in other species, making them more difficult to count. 'Traditionally, ageing sharks has relied on the assumption that band pairs are annual. In many cases this has been proven correct for part or all of a species life, however in more and more cases this is being disproven,' said researcher Lisa Natanson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northeast Fisheries Science Center lab in Narragansett, R.I. For the new study , researchers took advantage of the fact that nuclear testing during the 1950s and 1960s flooded the oceans with radioactive carbon, or carbon-14. Because carbon-14 degenerates into non-radioactive carbon at a consistent rate, the researchers were able to use carbon-14 concentrations to date the different tissue layers in the vertebrae of four male and four female great white sharks caught in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean between 1967 and 2010. The study showed that the oldest of the four females was 40 years old, while the oldest male was 73. If a lifespan of 70 years or more is typical, that would make great white sharks among longest lived of all cartilaginous fishes. The study also confirmed that, while growth bands are indeed laid down annually in small to medium-large great white sharks, the rate of band deposition may change later in life. In addition, many bands become so thin that they are effectively uncountable. 'This research demonstrates the power of applying cutting-edge techniques in isotope geochemistry to answer fundamental questions in ocean ecology,' researcher Simon Thorrold said. 'The radiocarbon time stamp in white shark vertebrae provides irrefutable evidence of white shark longevity that had proved to be impossible to verify using traditional age estimation methods.' Conservation implications The study also shows that great white sharks grow and mature much more slowly than had previously been thought. This implies that the species is even more vulnerable to overfishing, habitat degradation and other extinction risks than had been previously thought. 'These findings change the way we model white shark populations and must be taken into consideration when formulating future conservation strategies,' researcher Greg Skomal said. 'Understanding longevity of the species, growth rate, age at sexual maturity, and differences in growth between males and females are especially important for sustainable management and conservation efforts,' Hamady said. \n",
      " Correlations between lifestyle and male fertility have been made in numerous studies over recent years. Some show that well fed sperm cells are most likely to achieve successful fertilization, while others confirm what most of us already suspected: that bad diet and lifestyle choices are an important cause of male infertility. Saturated fats reduce sperm counts, whole grains and fruits boost them Saturated fats, are not just harder to digest, they may even be responsible for dwindling sperm counts in men. A recent study on young Danish men found that those who had a diet high in foods containing a lot of saturated fats (cheese, cream, fatty meats, chocolate and processed foods) also had 38 percent lower sperm concentrations and 41 percent lower sperm counts than men who did not consume an excess of saturated fats. Last year, a Brazilian study found that whole grains have a positive impact on sperm counts and viability, and that increased consumption of fresh fruits boosted sperm speed and agility. Things like obesity, drug, alcohol and coffee consumption, but also excessive heat, have the opposite effect, reducing motility (which describes how well the sperm 'swims'). Top five food groups to boost sperm count Not all fats are created equal: heart-healthy Omega-3 is also great for your sperm. A study published in the journal Human Reproduction found that men who had a higher intake of Omega-3 had the healthiest looking sperms. Flax seeds, chia seeds , hemp, and walnuts are bursting with Omega-3 fats, vitamin D, protein, dietary fiber, iron, calcium, and disease fighting antioxidants. According to best selling pregnancy and parenting author Heidi Murkoff , Omega-3 fats have the ability to improve blood flow to the genital area, which in turn ensures better sexual function and healthier sperm cells. Kale, spinach, collards, asparagus, avocados and beans are loaded with folic acid, which is an important constituent of healthy sperms. Low levels of folic acid have been linked to sperm cells with chromosomal abnormalities. Oysters and blackcurrant, but also spices like mustard, sesame, and celery seeds are excellent sources of zinc and selenium, trace elements that have been strongly linked to male fertility . One study found that zinc deficiency decreased testicular function in four out of five men. Citrus fruits, red peppers and sweet potatoes contain some folic acid as well, but more importantly, they are rich in vitamin C, which is necessary for folic acid absorption. Vitamin C also reduces oxidative stress on sperm cells, improving their life span and motility. Vitamin A is crucial for the maturation of healthy sperm cells. It is used in very precise biological processes that ensure the replication of healthy genetic material. Low vitamin A intake in men could undermine the sperm cells chances of reaching and fertilizing the egg. Heidi Murkoff described sperm low in vitamin A as 'sluggish' in her 2009 best selling book 'What to expect before you're expecting.' \n",
      " Evidence is increasingly emerging that a Western diet may be a significant risk factor for asthma. Asthma is a growing and serious health problem worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , in 2003 asthma was responsible for 4,261 deaths, 484,000 hospitalizations, 1.2 million hospital outpatient visits and 1.9 million emergency room visits across the United States. One of the studies providing strong support for a link between asthma and a Western diet was published in the European Respiratory Journal in 2008. French and Mexican researchers divided 54,672 French women into three separate groups, classified by their overall dietary habits: a 'prudent' pattern, characterized by high intake of fruits and vegetables; a 'nuts and wine' pattern, characterized by those foods; and a 'Western' pattern, characterized by high intake of cured meats, pizza, desserts and salty pies. The researchers found that participants in the 'Western' group experienced significantly more asthma attacks than participants in the other groups, while participants in the 'nuts and wine' group (perhaps approximating the Mediterranean diet) experienced significantly fewer. 'Overall diet could be involved in frequent asthma exacerbations, one aspect of asthma severity,' the researchers concluded. Cut out those hamburgers This was followed by a study published in the journal Thorax in 2010, which looked at more than 50,000 children in 20 separate countries. The researchers found that among children living in wealthy countries, eating three or more hamburgers per week was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing asthma . This link was not seen in poorer countries; in all countries, however, a higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing asthma. A 2013 study, published in the journal Allergy , found an even stronger effect, with children who ate one hamburger per week shown to be 75 percent more likely to suffer from asthma and twice as likely to suffer from wheezing as children who ate fewer hamburgers. Other fast foods were also linked to increased asthma risk. Another large study, also published in 2013, looked not just at hamburgers but at a large number of foods including meat, fish, fast food, dairy products, eggs, fruits and vegetables, potatoes and various grain products. Only fast food intake was significantly associated with increased asthma risk among both younger and older children. Only consumption of fruit three or more times a week was associated with a lower risk in both age groups. Higher fast food intake also increased the occurrence and severity of asthma symptoms in both younger and older children. 'Such consistency adds some weight to the possible causality of the relationship,' the researchers wrote. Change your diet for immediate relief According to a 2010 study conducted by researchers from the University of Newcastle , a high-fat diet like the Western diet might not just increase your risk of developing asthma, but may actually worsen the immediate effects of the disease. Researchers assigned 40 participants to eat either a high-fat meal containing 1,000 calories (52 percent from fat ) or a low-fat meal containing 200 calories (13 percent from fat). The researchers found that immediately after the high-fat meal, participants had significantly higher levels of inflammation-triggering cells called neutrophils in their sputum than participants who had eaten the low-fat meal. In addition, three to four hours after the meal, participants in the high high-fat group were less responsive to an asthma inhaler than those in the low-fat group. 'This suggests that strategies aimed at reducing dietary fat intake may be useful in managing asthma,' researcher Lisa Wood said. \n",
      " You can eliminate bedbugs from your home without chemicals, using traps that can be built for about a dollar's worth of supplies, say scientists at the University of Florida. 'This concept of trapping works for places where people sleep and need to be protected at those locations,' entomologist Phil Koehler said. In recent years, bedbugs have become a growing problem across the United States, with the blood-sucking insects turning up in cities nationwide. According to an April 2013 survey by the National Pest Management Association, 99.6 percent of all pest management professionals in the country had encountered at least one bedbug infestation in the previous year. Forty-nine percent of those surveyed said that most infestations occurred during summer. The association said that summer might be a busy bedbug season because more people are traveling or relocating, and are either bringing bedbugs back into their homes or discovering them in their new location. Although most famous for living in mattresses and bedding, bedbugs can live in nearly any furniture. Their bites are often confused for mosquito bites or rashes, allowing them to go undetected for long periods of time. Traps are cheap, safe and effective Because bedbugs have now become resistant to most pesticides, people often turn to extreme measures to deal with them. But Koehler warns that techniques such as mothballs, bug bombs or pesticide treatment of mattresses are either ineffective or dangerous. In contrast, the traps are an easy way to both determine if your home has bedbugs , and to eliminate them if an infestation is confirmed. Koehler estimates that it would take about an afternoon to make the 50 traps needed to remove bedbugs from a three-bedroom apartment. Compared with the average $3,000 price tag for bedbug extermination in such a space however, the time investment may be well worth it. It can cost $1,200 to eliminate bedbugs even from a small apartment. The traps, made with glue, masking tape and inexpensive plastic containers, present the bedbugs with a rough surface that makes it possible for them to get in, but with a smooth surface inside that makes it impossible for them to get out. They are designed to trap the insects as they move from their daytime hiding places in search of victims to feed on. The simple nature of the traps makes them basically foolproof, Koehler said, and much safer than the alternatives. 'It's really hard to mess this up to the point that you'd hurt anything,' he said. Five easy steps You can find instructions, photos and videos of how to construct the traps on the web site of the university's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. In essence, however, all that is required is: 1. Cut four pieces of rough-surfaced tape into lengths at least the height of a small plastic container. 2. Press the pieces of tape along the inside of the container, evenly spaced. 3. Wrap more tape around the outside of a larger plastic container, from its base to its upper edge. 4. Glue the smaller container inside the larger one, making sure to leave space between the walls of the containers. 5. (optional) Dust the space between the walls of the containers with baby powder. The bedbugs will be able to climb into the larger container and perhaps even into the smaller one, but will be trapped in the 'moat' between the two containers and unable to escape. The traps should be placed underneath the legs of all furniture in the home, including beds, chairs and sofas. Trapping should continue until no more bedbugs are turning up inside the traps.

      " Medicare spends more than a billion dollars every year on a variety of breast cancer screenings, especially mammography. There must be a good medical reason for these tests, right? Not according to researchers at Yale School of Medicine. In a study just published online in JAMA Internal Medicine, the scientists say there is no evidence spending this huge amount of money on breast screening benefits older women at all. The research team, headed by Cary Gross, M.D., associate professor of internal medicine at Yale School of Medicine and director of the Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center at Yale, assessed overall national costs, as well as variation in costs across geographic regions, of breast screenings in older women, associated work-ups and treatment of any findings. In all, the group studied over 137,000 women on Medicare who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer in prior years. The women were followed for two years so the researchers could learn how they were screened, whether they were diagnosed with breast cancer, and how much the screening and associated treatments cost. Spending more does not increase cancer detection 'Although screening costs varied more than two-fold across geographic regions, there was no evidence that higher expenditures (due to the use of newer, more expensive screening technologies) in the higher-cost areas were benefiting women living in the high-cost regions,' Gross, who is a member of Yale Cancer Center, said in a media statement. 'Specifically, there was no relation between screening expenditures and the detection of advanced cancers.' Amazingly, despite the fact guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task Force state there's no good evidence that breast cancer screenings have any benefit for women who are age 75 and older, the new research revealed that over $400 million is being spent every year screening Medicare beneficiaries in this very age group. 'In some instances, breast cancer screening can save lives. But no woman wants to undergo testing if it is likely to cause more harm than good, and no health system -- particularly ours -- can afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on screening programs without evidence to support them,' Gross concluded in the media statement. As N aturalNews has previously reported, University of California at San Francisco researchers have also sounded the alarm that unneeded, expensive mammograms are being pushed on elderly women -- specifically those who are incapacitated from Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia and likely terminally ill, especially if the women have savings or assets of $100,000 or more. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health , was based on information from Medicare claims. \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) showed a special interest in and appreciation for homeopathic medicine. In 1854, before Lincoln was elected president, he was retained as a lawyer to prepare a state legislative proposal to charter a homeopathic medical college in Chicago. Because Chicago was the home of the American Medical Association, which had been founded in 1847 in part to stop the growth of homeopathy, Lincoln's job was no simple effort. However, many of Chicago's most prominent citizens and politicians participated on the board of trustees of the proposed Hahnemann Medical College, including Chicago's mayor, two congressmen, an Illinois state representative, a Chicago city councilman, the co-founder of Northwestern University, the founder of Chicago Union Railroad, and several medical doctors who were homeopaths (Spiegel and Kavaler, 2002). Despite significant opposition, Lincoln was successful in obtaining a charter for the homeopathic college. Today, the Pearson Museum at Southern Illinois University has an exhibit of a nineteenth-century doctor's office and drug store; included in this exhibit is a homeopathic medicine kit from the Diller Drug Store of Springfield, Illinois. The exhibit notes that Abraham Lincoln was a frequent customer of the drug store and a regular user of homeopathic medicines (Karst, 1988, 11). Lincoln surrounded himself with advocates for homeopathy, especially his most trusted advisor and Secretary of State, William Steward. Ultimately, the story of what happened to William Seward is a classic story in medical history that exemplifies conventional medicine's attitude toward and actions against unconventional medical treatments and the physicians who provide them. On the night Lincoln was assassinated, Seward was stabbed in the multi-person assassination plot against the Union. Thanks to the medical care provided by Joseph K. Barnes, MD, U.S. Surgeon General, Seward survived. However, because Seward's personal physician was a homeopathic doctor and because the AMA had a policy that it was an ethical violation to consult with a homeopathic doctor or even provide care for a homeopathic patient, Dr. Barnes was denounced by the vice president of the AMA for providing medical care (Haller, 2005, 192). In addition to choosing Seward to be his secretary of state, several leading advisors were homeopathic advocates. On November 1, 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George Brinton McClellan (1826-1885) to command the Union army during the Civil War. However, in late December McClellan contracted typhoid fever, which left him unable to go to his office to conduct business (Rafuse, 1997). During the first week of McClellan's illness, two homeopathic doctors arrived from New York to care for the ill general and his father-in-law and chief of staff, Randolph B. Marcy, who was also ill. McClellan's decision to employ homeopathic doctors is particularly interesting considering the fact that the general came from a family of prominent conventional physicians. Despite this serious illness, General McClellan remained active, giving regular orders to his subordinates, arranging for troop movement and supply transport, meeting with the president on a weekly basis, issuing court martial orders, and even providing commendations to officers. By January 2, he seemed to be much better and shortly afterwards he had no noticeable physical limitations. McClellan lived another twenty-three years. Despite the success of this homeopathic treatment on the military leader of the Union army, that very month, January 1862, the Army Medical Board rejected requests by homeopathic doctors to serve in military hospitals, arguing that to grant this request would invite applications from all types of quacks and charlatans claiming medical expertise. Typhoid fever caused more deaths during the Civil War and the Spanish-American War than the deaths caused by bullets (Wershub, 1967, 175). Despite the fact that homeopathy gained widespread popularity in the United States and Europe due to its successes in treating various infectious disease epidemics of the mid- and late-1800s, including typhoid epidemics (Bradford, 1900; Coulter, 1973), the antagonism against homeopathy and homeopaths led to government regulations stipulating that graduates of homeopathic medical colleges could not receive a commission for military service. In Connecticut, several 'irregular' physicians offered their services to the governor, who accepted them, but the examining board of the Union army rejected them and instead accepted recruits from a hastily graduated class from Yale College. Although the Union army had strict restrictions against homeopathic physicians, the Confederate army did not. In fact, the physician to the wife of the Confederate army's General Robert E. Lee was a homeopathic doctor, Alfred Hughes, MD (Hughes, 1904, 39). At least in one incidence, General Lee himself was known to have taken homeopathic medicines (Mainwaring and Riley, 2005). Thankfully, the antagonism toward homeopaths was not as severe during World War I; almost 2,000 homeopathic physicians were commissioned as medical officers. Even the American Red Cross authorized a homeopathic hospital unit (Dearborn, 1923). Lincoln was also known to appoint some homeopathic physicians to political positions. For instance, in 1863 he appointed Dr. J. G. Hunt, author of a book on homeopathy and surgery (Hill and Hunt, 1855), to be consul to Nicaragua (King, 1905, I, 177). Lincoln also signed a bill into law that gave the president the authority to make appointments to the Union army's medical department, including homeopaths (Haller, 2005, 187). However, orthodox physicians strongly asserted that they would not work with homeopaths in any way, thus creating new and more difficult problems in military medicine. Although Lincoln surrounded himself with advocates for homeopathy, that didn't protect the medical science from his famous wit. He once called homeopathy 'medicine of a shadow of a pigeon's wing.' On a more serious note, it should also be mentioned that the personal physician to Mary Lincoln (1818-1882) during the later part of her life was a homeopathic physician and surgeon from Chicago, Dr. Willis Danforth. Mary Lincoln was known to have experienced serious bouts of depression after her husband was assassinated and two of her children died, one at age 11 (1862) and the other at 18 (1871). Mary Lincoln became the sole heir of the Lincoln estate and her extravagant spending and unusual behavior later in life concerned her son Robert so much that in 1874, he sought to get her declared insane and sent to a mental asylum. The testimony of her homeopath, Danforth, confirmed her insanity because he noted that Mrs. Lincoln experienced 'nervous derangement' and had delusions. She was committed to the asylum, but was free to move about the grounds, and was released three months later. Recent research has uncovered strong evidence to suggest that Mary Lincoln also suffered from syphilis, which may help explain her crazed mental state (Hayden, 2003, 120-132).

      " Sticking more closely to a Mediterranean diet may lead to a longer life, according to a new study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine . The researchers say that the study is the first to examine a connection between the diet and mortality in a U.S. population. Researchers examined data on more than 160,000 women and 200,000 men who had filled out detailed questionnaires about their eating habits, weight, age, smoking status and other factors known to affect health. The researchers then ranked participants based on how closely they held to either a traditional Mediterranean diet or an alternate Mediterranean diet. Participants scored higher for adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet if they ate more fruits and nuts, grains, beans, fish and vegetables (excluding potatoes), and if they ate less dairy, meat or saturated fat. Those who drank a moderate amount of alcohol, defined as five to 25 grams per day for women and 10 to 50 grams per day for men, also scored higher. The alternative Mediterranean diet was scored similarly, but included only whole (not refined) grains, did not include dairy products, counted fruits and nuts separately, used the same alcohol standard for men and women, and deducted points for meat only if it was red or processed. The people who stuck most closely to either Mediterranean diet were significantly less likely to die during the first five years after the surveys were taken. Among women who followed the alternate Mediterranean diet most closely, mortality was reduced by 22 percent, with mortality form heart disease 21 percent lower and deaths from cancer lowered by 14 percent. The numbers for men were similar. The association between the Mediterranean diet and decreased mortality seemed strongest among smokers, particularly smokers who were of healthy body weight. Among both smokers and non-smokers, those who were obese did not appear to have their lives lengthened by the Mediterranean diet. \n",
      " At a time when the nation was involved in two wars and there was already plenty of strain on the military's budget, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was pressuring the Defense Department to spend scarce Pentagon resources (and taxpayer dollars) to research irritable bowel syndrome. The revelation was contained in a new book, Duty , by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who admitted when he received the request from Reid that he didn't quite know how to react to it, especially given that with 'all the major issues we had to deal with, my personal contacts with Senate Majority Leader Reid were often in response to his calls about Air Force objections to construction of a windmill farm in Nevada because of the impact on their radars,' Gates wrote. 'He also once contacted me to urge that Defense invest in research on irritable bowel syndrome,' he said. 'With two ongoing wars and all our budget and other issues, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.' It wasn't the only time that Reid, who has a history of outrageous behavior and silly requests, got on the bad side of Gates. 'Disgraceful' The former defense chief, who served during the Bush and Obama administrations, said that one time the Senate majority leader made the comment during the troop surge in the Iraq War that 'this war is lost' [ http://www.youtube.com ] - a statement that Gates described as 'disgraceful.' 'I think the troops knew the score,' Gates said recently during an interview on MSNBC. 'The troops believed and believe that they were being successful in their mission. So I think they were able to a certain extent to set aside the politics here at home.' 'Although,' he said emphatically, 'I make the point in the book: when you have somebody like the Senate Majority Leader come out in the middle of the surge and say 'this war is lost' - I thought that was one of the most disgraceful things I've heard a politician say. That sends a riveting message to kids who are putting their lives on the line every day, that they're doing it for nothing, and that was absolutely not the case.' In his book, Gates wrote this about the incident: 'I was furious and shared privately with some of my staff a quote from Abraham Lincoln I had written down long before. 'Congressmen who willfully take actions during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested, exiled or hanged.'' In the days since, Reid has fired back at Gates, impugning his character - which is typical for a politician to do - and questioning his motives for writing Duty . 'Just out to make a buck ' In comments last week, Reid said Gates was making certain charges about him and others in the Obama administration because he was 'out to make a buck' (though Gates' net worth is already north of $5 million - about the same as Reid's). 'He denigrates everybody, everyone, Secretary (of State Hillary Rodham) Clinton, the president, (Vice President) Joe Biden, me,' Reid told reporters. He added that he hadn't talked to Obama about the book but he has spoken to Biden about it. 'We just lamented how disappointed we were. It's obvious it's to sell a book,' he said. 'I'm surprised he would in effect denigrate everybody he came in contact with in an effort to make a buck.' Elsewhere in the book, Gates described additional interaction with Reid, saying the Nevada Democrat called him in 2008 before Obama had named a running mate, as reported by the Associated Press: 'Reid said he was thinking about me. ... He asked if I had a public position on abortion; I laughed, saying no. He asked if I was a longtime Republican; I said actually, no.' Gates wrote that Reid wanted to keep the conversation private, adding, 'I couldn't figure out if he was serious, if it was just idle flattery, or if he was delusional.'

      " Tweet (NewsTarget) A diet rich in fiber can halve the risk of breast cancer among young women, according to a new study by Leeds University. Cereal fiber, such as that found in whole bread and cereals, was found to be particularly effective. '[This] study further highlights the importance of eating a healthy diet for reducing the risk of cancer,' said Ed Yong, information officer for Cancer Research UK. Researchers found no significant effect, however, on the breast cancer risk of post-menopausal women. Janet Cade, who headed the study, says that this is why no one has noticed the effects of fiber on breast cancer before. 'Previous research hasn't shown a convincing link between increased dietary fiber and the lower risk of breast cancer,' Cade said. 'But earlier studies didn't draw any distinction between pre- and post-menopausal women.' According to the study's authors, there are three possible reasons for the anti-cancer effects of a high fiber diet: First, fiber has a stabilizing effect on the body's insulin levels. High insulin levels have been shown to contribute to the risk of cancer. Second, high-fiber foods also tend to be rich in other essential nutrients, including those with antioxidant properties. Third, and perhaps most relevant, dietary fiber reduces the levels of estrogen in the body, which has been shown to correlate with the risk of breast cancer. These levels are higher in younger women, which may explain the age split that researchers discovered. According to the study, pre-menopausal women should eat at least 30 grams of fiber per day to reduce their cancer risk. By contrast, the American Dietetic Association recommends a minimum of 25 grams per day for a 2,000-calorie diet. Breast cancer is the second most fatal cancer among women, after lung cancer. Between one in 13 and one in nine women will contract it at some point in their lives. The study was funded by the World Cancer Research Fund and published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. ### \n",
      " Past research bodies have confirmed the health-protective effect of a natural diet rich in flavonoids to protect against a wide range of diseases including heart disease, hypertension, some cancers, and dementia. Researchers from Harvard University and the University of East Anglia have published the result of a study in the journal Neurology that demonstrates how these plant-based phytonutrients can significantly lower the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, especially in men. Flavonoids from healthy foods such as berries, tea, apples, and red wine cross the delicate blood-brain barrier to protect neurons against neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's. This large scale study included more than 130,000 men and women participants that were followed for a period of twenty years. During this time, more than 800 individuals developed Parkinson's disease. A diet high in flavonoids from berries lowers Parkinson's disease risk by forty percent After a detailed analysis of their diets and adjusting for age and lifestyle, male participants who ate the most flavonoids were shown to be forty percent less likely to develop the disease than those who ate the least. No similar link was found for total flavonoid intake in women. Co-lead study author, Dr. Aedin Cassidy noted 'These exciting findings provide further confirmation that regular consumption of flavonoids can have potential health benefits.' This was the first study to examine the connection between flavonoid consumption and the development of Parkinson's disease. The findings suggest that a sub-class of flavonoids called anthocyanins may exhibit neuroprotective effects. Participants consuming one or more portions of berry fruits each week were around twenty-five percent less likely to develop Parkinson's disease, relative to those who did not eat berry fruits.Flavonoids are the bioactive, naturally occurring chemical compounds found in many plant-based foods and drinks. This study demonstrated the main protective effect was from the consumption of anthocyanins, which are present in berries and other fruits and vegetables including aubergines, blackcurrants, and blackberries. Strawberries and blueberries are the two most common sources of flavonoids in the US diet, contributing to a twenty-four percent lowered risk in this research. Parkinson's disease is among a group of chronic diseases presently affecting one in 500 people, with new cases on the rise. Drug therapies are ineffective and bear significant side effects. The result of this study provides yet another example of the power of a natural diet in the prevention of many debilitating and deadly conditions. Nutrition experts recommend adding a minimum of three to five servings of flavonoids to your diet each week. Include all varieties of berries, apples, and green tea to guard against Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative illnesses. \n",
      " A report recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that black women who consume fried chicken or fast food burgers at least twice a week are between 40 and 70 percent more prone to develop type 2 diabetes over the course of a decade than those who do not. Not only black women but all people who consume high calorie, low nutrient fast foods on even a moderate basis are susceptible to developing the disease. Dr. Julie Palmer and her colleagues from Boston University analyzed over 44,000 black women who were instructed to complete questionnaires that they were given beginning back in 1995. Once concluded, researchers compared the results with another group of women who claimed never to eat fast food. The result was that not only were the women who ate fast food more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than the non-fast food group, they also were generally heavier with many falling into the overweight range. The standard measuring tool for determining healthy body weight is the Body Mass Index (BMI). A healthy BMI is somewhere between 18.5 and 24.9. Most of the participants in the fast food group were somewhere between 28 and 29 when they started the study, which according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is overweight. Those in this group also continued to gain more weight during the course of the study. Interestingly, the two foods that played the largest role in blood sugar disorder were fast food hamburgers and fried chicken. These foods were implicated in causing the most weight gain which resulted in more cases of diabetes . Nearly 3,000 women in the fast food eating group developed type 2 diabetes by the time the study concluded. A previous fast food study conducted in 2004 by researchers from Boston Children's Hospital found similar results. After tracking more than 3,000 young adults for over 15 years, researchers found that people who ate at fast food restaurants more than twice a week gained an average of almost 10 pounds more than those who went only once a week. The twice a week group also had a 200 percent increase in insulin resistance compared to the once a week group. Experts also concluded that those who ate the most fast food lived the most unhealthy lifestyles in general and were the most prone to developing other serious diseases throughout the course of their lives. While some experts suggest consuming smaller portion sizes and less overall calories, a better option would be to make better food choices. Eating less fast food is good, but changing one's lifestyle to include whole, living foods is even better.

      " The advance of robotics in recent years has been incredible and is now about to enter a new era, according to reports. Indeed, 'humanoid' types of robots are expected to hit American retailers sometime next year. Bloomberg News reports that billionaire Masayoshi Son will begin selling a kind of humanoid robot named 'Pepper' by summer 2015 at Sprint Corp. stories in the United States, which is part of a push by SoftBank Corp. to move the technology beyond the factory. In addition, SoftBank says it has received nearly 400 inquiries about its humanoid robot from companies in finance, food service and education, said Fumihide Tomizawa, chief executive officer of SoftBank Robotics, in an interview with Bloomberg News . The 1.2-meter (4-foot) robot 'dances, makes jokes and estimates human emotions based on expressions,' the news service reported. Pepper will be on sale in Japan in February for about $1,900; the company has yet to set a price for it in the U.S. 'We want to build a society that coexists with robots' Last year, SoftBank paid $22 billion for control of Sprint; now, the company has begun to invest in robotics as Japan looks to double the value of its current domestic production to 2.41 trillion yen ($22.9 billion) by 2020. The company has developed an operating system that can control robots much the same as Google's Android software can run a smartphone. Its platform is able to be customized so it can be used in a range of industries including construction, healthcare and entertainment. 'We will sell Pepper in the United States within a year after gathering information in Japan,' Tomizawa told Bloomberg News . 'I won't be surprised if Pepper sales will be half to business and half to consumers.' In July, SoftBank Robotics was launched as a subsidiary to direct the company's business and begin selling Pepper; the robot comes equipped with a laser sensor and a battery that can last up to 12 hours. As further reported by Bloomberg News : The robot was initially targeted at families and the elderly before getting attention for business use since its June unveiling. Tomizawa declined to specify the company's sales targets for robotics. SoftBank expects to generate revenue through applications and original content as customers personalize their robots. 'The basic premise is to produce profit,' Tomizawa said. 'Son is aggressively involved in the project and we report to him one or two times a month.' In 2010, Son described his vision for the future: Create a society where humans coexist with intelligent robots. He has also said that Pepper is a result of time he has spent watching the television show Astro Boy , a cartoon series in the 1960s based on a character who could not experience emotions. In July, Son said he believes that he can improve labor productivity by replacing 90 million jobs with one-third as many robots. 'We could enter the robot business for industrial use in the mid or long term,' Tomizawa explained. China ramping up production too SoftBank's robot development coincides with robotics companies acquired recently by Google, including Schaft Inc., a Tokyo-based company that manufactures two-legged humanoid robots . Other robot firms include Honda Motor Co., which has developed a robot that plays soccer, and Panasonic Corp. Meanwhile, in neighboring China, robotics production is ramping up as well. According to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency, the country's first industrial robot line should begin operation this month in the northeastern city of Shenyang, officials said. The Saisun Robot and Automation Co. Ltd. 'will be the first to jump start China's industrial robot production with an annual capacity of 5,000,' the news agency reported. In 2013, China became the world's largest industrial robot market, with 37,000 units sold. That was 20 percent of the global market.

      " Tweet Nerve cells that normally are not light sensitive in the retinas of blind mice can respond to light when a green algae protein called channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is inserted into the cell membranes, according to a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported study published in the April 6, 2006 issue of the journal Neuron. The study was conducted with mice that had been genetically bred to lose rods and cones, the light-sensitive cells in the retina. This condition is similar to the blinding disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in humans. Vision normally begins when rods and cones, also called photoreceptors, respond to light and send signals through the retina and the optic nerve to the visual cortex of the brain, where visual images are formed. Unfortunately, photoreceptors degenerate and die in some genetic diseases, such as RP. Both mice and humans go progressively blind because with the loss of rods and cones there is no signal sent to the brain. This study, funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the NIH, raises the intriguing possibility that visual function might be restored by conveying light-sensitive properties to other surviving cells in the retina after the rods and cones have died. Principal investigator Zhuo-Hua Pan, Ph.D., of Wayne State University School of Medicine, and his colleagues, using a gene-transfer approach, introduced the light-absorbing protein ChR2 into the mouse retinal cells that survived after the rods and cones had died. These cells became light sensitive and sent signals through the optic nerve to the visual cortex. This innovative gene-transfer approach is certainly compelling, said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of vision research at the NIH. This is a clever approach that offers the possibility of some extent of vision restoration at some time in the future. In addition to RP, there are many forms of retinal degenerative eye diseases that possibly could be treated by gene-based therapies. The researchers determined that the signals reached the visual cortex in a majority of the ChR2-treated mice. The light sensitivity persisted for at least six months. Did the mice regain usable vision? Probably not, but the investigators suggest a number of technical improvements to their experiments which might make that possible. This study demonstrates the feasibility of restoring visual responses in mice after they lose the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells, said Dr. Pan. He and his colleague, Alexander Dizhoor, Ph.D., of Pennsylvania College of Optometry, another of the study authors, think that expressing ChR2 in other types of retinal cells may help to improve this approach. In addition, the authors state it would be interesting for further study to modify the light sensitivity and/or wavelength selectivity of ChR2, or use similar microbial proteins, to produce diverse light-sensitive channels to improve outcomes for the possible restoration of normal vision. The National Eye Institute (NEI) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is the Federal government's lead agency for vision research that leads to sight-saving treatments and plays a key role in reducing visual impairment and blindness.

      " Tweet As the song says, 'You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone' -- and motor skills are no exception. Despite the ranking of the opposable thumb as one of the single most important evolutionary advantages of the human race, many people take the use of their hands for granted until something draws their attention to it, such as arthritis. Joseph B. Marion, author of 'The Anti-Aging Manual', says that an estimated 41 million Americans suffer from arthritis. Arthritis is actually a term covering over 100 rheumatic diseases; but basically, the affliction can be defined as an inflammation of the joints. According to http://www.rlrouse.com, the two most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis, which generally is caused by every day wear and tear on the foot or poor choices of shoe design, and rheumatoid arthritis, which occurs when the body's autoimmune system begins attacking its own cells, causing joint deterioration and deformation. Some researchers believe a bacterium or virus causes this body malfunction, and others believe that certain people are more genetically susceptible to the condition. This is not to say that some people are genetically predestined to get arthritis, only that some genetic traits put them at more risk. Although the exact catalyst that causes the body's immune system to attack its own synovium is unknown, the website, http://solvearthritisnow.com, lists some of the common things that can worsen the symptoms. These include lectins, such as those found in lima beans, lentils, and nightshade vegetables, food allergies, especially sensitivity to wheat and dairy products, and chemical sensitivities, particularly smoking or second-hand smoke. Arthritis is different from most afflictions in that it isn't always a chronic condition. In a few cases, arthritis will only cause noticeable discomfort during 'flare-ups' which are often caused by changes in barometric pressure and cold weather. Rheumatoid arthritis usually attacks the joints of individuals between 20 and 60, but it has been known to plague some younger joints as well in a condition known as juvenile arthritis. After age 70, new instances of the disease seem to decline. According to http://www.neckreference.com, the condition affects women three times more than men. Foods to avoid for arthritis sufferers According to Phyllis A. Balch, author of 'Prescription for Dietary Wellness,' some arthritis sufferers should avoid nightshade vegetables, so named because they grow in the shade of night rather than during the day. Vegetables in this group include potatoes, eggplant, peppers (although direct application of peppers on joints can be helpful), and tomatoes. Nightshades contain an alkaloid called solanine, which seems to have a negative effect on calcium balance, and can even cause headaches. Balch cites Norman F. Childers, a former professor of horticulture at Rutgers University in New Jersey and author of 'The Nightshades and Health.' Childers was an arthritis sufferer who noticed increased joint pain and stiffness after consuming any type of tomatoes. Childers experimented with his consumption of nightshades. After he had eliminated all nightshade vegetables from his diet, Childers found his arthritis pain to have subsided. Childers concluded, 'Regular consumption of tomatoes, potatoes and eggplants is a primary cause of arthritis.' Childers suggests avoiding nightshade vegetables for a month and observing whether symptoms subside or are alleviated. Other substances to avoid include tobacco, coffee, caffeinated tea, salt, artificial colors, and preservatives. Meat is also said to aggravate arthritis, as it is high in uric acid, a primary factor in the aggravation of symptoms. The effects of uric acid can be mitigated by not consuming meat, while consuming dandelion greens, parsley, alfalfa, and the herb devil's claw. Treating arthritis naturally The conventional medical theory is that there is no cure for arthritis, only treatments for joint pain and inflammation, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and the nutritional supplement glucosamine. But anti-inflammatory medicines, while beneficial in the short-term, can begin to make the problem worse, as well as deteriorate the stomach and liver. There are surgical procedures to help with arthritis involving the draining of certain antibodies. Actual joint replacement is another procedure. But these seem rather barbaric. In the past, medical practitioners had even recommended the removal of teeth as a treatment for arthritis. Another dramatic and unorthodox treatment is a practice known as urtication, which involves using a gloved hand to 'sting' the afflicted joints with a herb known as 'stinging nettle,' or urtica dioica. Although slightly painful, James A. Duke talks of his success with stinging painful joints in 'The Green Pharmacy.' Some homeopathic practitioners have discovered a less dramatic approach, finding success in relieving arthritis pain with more natural treatments, such as the consumption of certain fruits and vegetable juices. Mark Stengler, author of 'Natural Physicians Healing Therapies,' says that vegetables and their juices contain phytonutrients which can be instrumental in aiding the body in regenerating cells a vital part of treating arthritis. Even orange juice can help since it contains vitamin C, an antioxidant. Antioxidants assist the body in the reduction of swelling and inflammation of the joints. Cherry juice for arthritis pain According to an interview with Eve Campanelli, PhD in Prevention magazine, 85 percent of Campanelli's patients had experienced at least partial relief of pain symptoms by drinking two glasses of black cherry juice (four ounces of juice diluted with four ounces of water) twice a day. In addition, Campanelli states that patients can discontinue consumption of the juice once their pain subsides. Campanelli recommends using cherries which have been kept cool and moist, and which have a deep maroon, mahogany, red, or black color. She suggests avoiding fruit of the following kind: those that are shriveled, with dried stems, soft flesh, brown discolorations, or a dull appearance. 'People with rheumatoid arthritis should include in their daily diets juices high in the anti-inflammatory nutrients,' said Cherie Calbom, M.S. Calbom is a certified nutritionist in Kirkland, Washington, and co-author of 'Juicing for Life.' Calbom adds that parsley, broccoli, and spinach can assist in the treatment of arthritis, since these contain beta-carotene, along with carrots, apples, and ginger, all of which contain copper. She also promotes the drinking of pineapple juice, since it is the only source of the strong anti-inflammatory enzyme bromelain. Bromelain helps the body breakdown protein. Incomplete protein break down (i.e. poor digestion) is a condition implicated in arthritis. Bromelain also helps break down plaque and fatty tissue deposits that can clog arteries. It also assists in the natural healing of bruises and minor abrasions. Other juices said to help include bilberry, celery juice, green barley juice, aloe vera juice, and boswellia extract. Birch cortisone can also help reduce inflammation of joints; however, cortisones can interfere with calcium absorption and should be used sparingly. Not all juices have a positive effect on arthritis symptoms. In 'The New Age Herbalist,' Richard Mabey states that spinach juice and spinach itself is bad for arthritis because it contains oxalic acid which can interfere with calcium absorption and exacerbate arthritic symptoms. Stengler says fish oil has been known to have a positive effect on arthritis symptoms. In one experiment, patients who completely supplemented their arthritis treatments and medications with fish oil while giving up their chemical treatments experienced no relapse in their arthritis symptoms. Stengler suggests using at least 3,000 milligrams daily, but added that some patients didn't require such a high dosage. 'Once you start taking fish oil, you can expect to stay on it for at least 12 weeks before it begins to yield benefits,' said Stengler, 'but after that, you can stay on it indefinitely.' However, Stengler suggests that fish oil be used only as one component of a complete arthritis treatment. Some schools of thought rely on acupuncture to assist in dealing with arthritis pain. Acupuncture is based on an ancient Chinese philosophy that the body has an energy called qi, pronounced 'chee.' Application of needles to certain points can restore the flow of qi along invisible channels called meridians. Theoretically, when meridians are disrupted, the body becomes ill in response, such as displaying symptoms of arthritis. Proponents of the practice explain it goes beyond temporary relief and actually re-patterns the body. With some of these lesser known treatment options, arthritis sufferers may no longer have to gravitate toward dry climates to find relief from their pain. Juices and diet changes may provide an equitable solution to the pain caused by arthritis. \n",
      " Analysts and experts have long maintained that the duration of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are having a detrimental effect on the nation's military personnel. Nowhere have the problems of high operational tempos and repeated combat deployments manifested themselves more than in the tens of thousands of soldiers and others who are increasingly being medicated in order to deal with the stress. In fact, according to recent figures released by the Army's surgeon general, more than 110,000 U.S. Army personnel were taking antidepressants, narcotics, sedatives, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs that were prescribed to them by doctors. With a renewed focus on individual soldier readiness by the Pentagon after a decade of war, it should trouble Defense Department officials - civilians and top officers alike - that nearly 8 percent of active duty Army troops are on sedatives, and another 6 percent are on antidepressants, figures that are up eightfold since 2005. So many psychotropic drug prescriptions are having an effect on more than just readiness, but also on legal issues affecting military members. 'In a small but growing number of cases across the nation, lawyers are blaming the U.S. military's heavy use of psychotropic drugs for their clients' aberrant behavior and related health problems,' The Los Angeles Times reported in early April. See the selfnews infographic on the psychiatric drugging of soldiers at: http://www.selfnews.com The problem is bad and getting worse Bart Billings, a former military psychologist who hosts an annual conference on combat stress, said the problem is real and it's growing. 'We have never medicated our troops to the extent we are doing now.... And I don't believe the current increase in suicides and homicides in the military is a coincidence,' he told the paper. Indeed, the Army suicide rate fell for the first time in four years in 2011, the result of aggressive service-wide efforts to identify those having problems early-on. But the rate is still high. It's about 24 per 100,000 last year, which is higher than a similar demographic among civilians, about 19 per 100,000. Among veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, that rate is even higher - about 38 per 100,000. Other problems are increasing too. 'Sexual assault and domestic violence have increased. The percentage of soldiers committing sex crimes has increased 32 percent since 2006,' USA Today reported. 'The number of domestic abusers in the Army grew by almost 50 percent from 4,827 in 2008 to 7,228 last year. During that same, the number of child-abuse offenders is up 62 percent from 3,172 to 5,149.' Too many meds, too little control Clearly, the up-tempo has had a negative effect on our fighting force. But making excuses or explaining away the phenomenon is denial, and it's not going to help the Pentagon and Congress solve the problem. 'It's not that we're using them more frequently or any differently,' said Col. Carol Labadie, the pharmacy consultant for the Army surgeon general. 'As with any medication, you have to look at weighing the risk versus the benefits of somebody going on a medication.' Experts say the problem isn't necessarily in the numbers. It's that you can't regulate the use of such medications in the military as easily as you can in the civilian world. Follow-up appointments, for example, are few and far between - especially on the battlefield. And soldiers are often sent out into combat zones with six months' worth of medications, enough to trade with their buddies or grab a fistful of pills at the end of a particularly stressful day or mission. Soldiers who have been wounded can easily become addicted to painkillers they are given. 'The big difference is these are people who have access to loaded weapons, or have responsibility for protecting other individuals who are in harm's way,' Grace Jackson, a former Navy staff psychiatrist who resigned her commission in 2002 in part out of concern that military shrinks were handing out too many medications, told the Times. The problem has begun to show up in court, where, increasingly, lawyers for military members on meds have begun to argue - successfully - that the psychotropic drug made them do it. James Culp, a former Army paratrooper who has since become a high-profile military defense lawyer, says he's recently defended an Army private accused of murder. His defense? The soldier's mental condition was exacerbated by the Zoloft he was prescribed. 'What do you do when 30-80 percent of the people that you have in the military have gone on three or more deployments, and they are mentally worn out? What do you do when they can't sleep? You make a calculated risk in prescribing these medications,' Culp told the paper. \n",
      " Artificially sweetened drinks are often promoted as healthy alternatives for weight loss and diabetes because they are low in calories and don't contain sugar. However, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that these diet sodas are harmful to human health. According to Sharon Fowler, MPH, an authority on this subject, 'Diet soda is not a health food. In fact, it's not a food at all, it's simply a slurry of chemicals, a number of which may have deleterious effects on the body.' Most recently diet sodas have been tied to increased risk of stroke and heart attack, and while many people drink them as an aid to weight reduction, research suggests if you drink diet soda, weight gain may be the result instead. Weight gain In one study linking diet beverages to weight gain, Hazuda, et. al. at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, recorded changes in waist circumferences in 474 elderly participants in a 10-year study. As part of the study they controlled for diabetes, physical activity, neighborhood, age, sex and ethnicity. Findings showed that increases in waist sizes were 70 percent greater among those who drank diet soft drinks compared with those who did not. In addition, waist size increases were as much as 500 percent greater amongst those that drank two or more diet sodas a day. In other research, Sharon Fowler and colleagues studied eight years of data based on individuals between 25 and 64. Of the study participants who were of normal weight in the beginning, a third were overweight or obese eight years later. In evaluating the correlation between obesity and diet drinks researchers found that every bottle of diet soda participants drank in a day raised their obesity risk by 41 percent. Diabetes Aspartame, a common sweetener in diet beverages, has also been linked to diabetes. In an animal study conducted at UT San Antonio, researchers fed corn oil-enriched feed to one group of mice and the same feed plus aspartame to another group. Three months later the aspartame group had elevated glucose levels but insulin levels that were equal to or less than those of the control group, suggesting that aspartame may be part of the connection between diet soda consumption and diabetes. Corrupted Signals What is the reason for the diet soda weight gain connection? One theory is that our bodies rely on a signaling system based on the quality of the foods we eat. In the case of diet soda , the body experiences a sweet taste and expects calories; but when they aren't forthcoming starts to crave food, which leads to overeating. Psychologists at Purdue University tested this idea by comparing two groups of rats, one which was fed yogurt with sugar and one which was fed yogurt with saccharine. The saccharine rats ate significantly more calories, gained more weight and put on more body fat than the control group. Sweet Cravings Still another possibility is that eating sweets dulls our taste buds causing us to eat more sugary foods in compensation. Some 2011 research in the UK seems to support this idea. The scientists found that consumption of two cans of soda a day for a month resulted in a noticeable dulling of taste buds and increased cravings for high calorie foods. Since artificial sweeteners (which were not part of this particular study) are 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar, it is at least possible that they may have a similar impact on our taste buds. \n",
      " Mothers who exercise more during pregnancy may give birth to children with higher IQs, according to psychologist Richard E. Nisbett, author of Intelligence and How to Get It . 'Children whose mother exercised 30 minutes a day score around eight points higher on standard IQ tests than children whose mothers were more sedentary,' he said. The Western medical profession once believed that exercise after the first trimester of pregnancy might place the fetus at risk, but new research is increasingly discrediting this idea. The British government recommends that women remain active throughout pregnancy, noting that the more active a woman is, the easier it will be for her body to adapt to the experience of pregnancy and the easier her labor will be. Running, stretching and using light weights are among the exercises that many pregnant women can do easily. 'Exercising large muscle groups increases the growth of neurons and adds to the blood supply of the brain,' Nisbett writes. A woman who exercises during pregnancy and also breastfeeds for at least nine months will raise her child's IQ an average of 14 points, he said. Nisbett says that the way parents interact with their children can also help boost their IQ. He encourages parents to ask their children questions that they already know the answer to, and to explain how they know. This helps children develop the ability to find the answers to their own questions. He also encourages the practice of 'anticipation exercises,' games in which parents encourage children to predict future events, such as where a submerged animal will emerge from the water. Research suggests that mothers are the most important influences in their children's intellectual development, he said, but that fathers contribute relatively little. 'The mother is the most important IQ agent here,' he said. 'In families dominated by a father, there are higher mathematical skills but that's all we contribute, I'm afraid.'

      " The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is launching an investigation into a still-unexplained collection of symptoms known as Morgellons disease. The condition known as Morgellons disease is characterized primarily by skin lesions that do not heal, as well as unexplained sensations of crawling, biting or stinging on the skin; the presence of foreign materials, such as fibers, on or under the skin; fatigue; joint pain; memory loss; mental confusion and vision changes. Because doctors do not know what causes the symptoms, some have questioned whether it is a real physical condition. According to the Morgellons Research Foundation, many Morgellons patients are falsely 'diagnosed with a common medical label, Delusions of Parasitosis, the basic tenet being this is a psychiatric illness with the presumption of a purely delusional 'parasite infestation.'' The CDC investigation will involve patients enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health Plan who saw medical attention for Morgellons-like symptoms within an 18-month time period. It will also involve cooperation from the Armed Forces Pathology Institute, and is expected to last for at least one year. Patients involved in the study will undergo thorough examinations of both mental and physical health. When asked if she believes that Morgellons disease is a real medical condition, lead researcher Michele Pearson said, 'What I can tell you is real is the suffering that these patients are experiencing. I cannot characterize this as a syndrome, as a disease. I can tell you it's an unexplained illness.' The Morgellons Research Foundation says that it has identified at least 11,000 families around the world that have at least one member who suffers from Morgellons disease. Executive Director Mary Leitao said that the CDC investigation is an important step toward finding out more about the condition, which she believes is 'an infectious disease.' \n",
      " Ex-smokers and others looking to give their lungs a natural health boost can find help in a surprising place: the sweet potato. And the healthful qualities of this remarkable vegetable don't end at the lungs: They extend to various types of cancer, and to a wide range of other health benefits. Sweet potatoes ( Ipomoea batatas ) have been consumed by human beings for thousands of years. There are more than 8,000 varieties, ranging in color from white to purple though yellow and orange varieties are most common, and are the types most strongly linked to lung health. Although people in the United States typically eat only the tuber of the plant, its leaves, roots and vines are also edible and cancer-fighting. Eat more sweet potato... leaves! Research into the effects of sweet potatoes on your lungs centers on the plant's high concentration of beta-carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A. This vitamin plays many important roles in the body, including in the health of the eyes, bones and immune system. Among other things, vitamin A and other carotenoids have been shown to aid in lung regeneration, including in people with emphysema. Another study, conducted by Taiwanese researchers and published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2007, gave food frequency questionnaires to 301 people with lung cancer, along with 602 hospital controls and 602 neighborhood controls. They found that people who ate the most sweet potato leaves were 43 to 65 percent less likely to develop lung cancer than those who ate the least. The study also found that those who had higher intakes of vitamin A, alpha-carotene or beta-carotene had a significantly lower risk of lung cancer. Overall vegetable intake was also associated with lower risk, although sweet potato leaves and garland chrysanthemum had the strongest effect. Not just for your lungs But the cancer-fighting benefits of sweet potatoes don't end there. Studies have shown that sweet potato extracts may reduce breast cancer tumor growth and inhibit leukemia cell growth; that the antioxidant anthocyanin (found in sweet potatoes and in red, blue and purple fruits and vegetables) reduces liver cancer tumor growth in mice; and that sweet potato intake may reduce the risk of gallbladder cancer in human beings. Another study found that while high intake of three to four separate varieties of starchy roots and tubers including sweet potatoes , potatoes and taro root had no effect on rates of kidney disease, it did significantly reduce death rates from the disease. It may not be just carotenoids that are responsible for these benefits. Sweet potatoes are also high in the antioxidant polyphenols caffeic acid, dicaffeoylquinic acid and tricaffeoylquinic acid, which may also have cancer-fighting effects. Sweet potatoes are also high in complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamin C, riboflavoin, magnesium, manganese, potassium, calcium and iron. Their complex sugars make sweet potatoes an ideal food for diabetics and others who struggle with blood sugar levels, while their high fiber content may aid digestion and fight colon cancer. Among vegetables, they are high in vitamin D, which plays a critical role in the functioning of the immune system. High levels of potassium and vitamin B6, along with fiber, make sweet potatoes a great food for your heart. Vitamin B6 also helps prevent strokes and degenerative diseases. The beta-carotene in sweet potatoes also promotes healthy hair growth and prevents hair damage. You can even get another use out of the water you use to boil sweet potatoes: You can use it as a wash or bath to cleanse pores, remove toxins and soothe irritated skin. \n",
      " Heart disease and stroke continues to rank as the leading, preventable cause of death in most Western societies, killing three-quarters of a million people combined. Any natural compound that can significantly lower the death rate from vascular diseases should be embraced by natural health advocates and the medical profession alike. Yet allopathic physicians continue to prescribe a host of ineffective and dangerous prescription medications that do little to combat this epidemic. The result of a study published in the British Medical Journal shows that dark chocolate consumption can reduce cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with metabolic syndrome (physical biomarkers that significantly increase the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes). Past studies have suggested that eating small amounts of dark chocolate (containing at least 60 percent cocoa solids) provides short-term heart protective effects. Australian researchers wanted to further determine if dark chocolate could provide long term benefits in an at-risk population. Dark chocolate found to significantly lower non-fatal and fatal vascular events Scientists assembled a cohort of 2,013 participants with existing markers for heart disease (high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome), but were not presently on medications. The group ate dark chocolate daily (equivalent to one ounce or one square of chocolate) for a period of ten years. The investigators used sophisticated risk-prediction algorithms and population life tables to determine the probability of patients developing or dying from heart disease or other non-cardiovascular causes each year. The study demonstrated that those individuals following the dietary chocolate protocol with 100 percent compliance could potentially avert 70 non-fatal and 15 fatal cardiovascular events per 10,000 people treated over 10 years. It is important to note that these risk reduction numbers are higher than many deadly pharmaceutical interventions. At a reduced compliance rate of 80 percent, the scientists found the number of non-fatal and fatal events potentially averted was 55 and 10 per 10,000 people treated over 10 years, still considered to be an effective intervention strategy. The study team noted that the findings are only relevant when consuming dark chocolate with a minimum cocoa content between 60 to 70 percent (prior studies suggest eighty percent cocoa content). Milk chocolate consumption does not lower risk of stroke or heart disease due to the high sugar content and lack of healthy cocoa flavonoids. The researchers concluded that daily dark chocolate consumption 'could represent an effective and cost effective strategy for people with metabolic syndrome (and no diabetes).' Health-minded individuals, especially those at risk or with a familial history of vascular disease may want to consider eating one ounce of high-cocoa content dark chocolate each day to shield against stroke and cardiovascular disease. \n",
      " The Obama administration, which regularly touts itself as a champion for minorities, is attempting to cheat thousands of Native Americans out of future compensation that is rightly theirs following a horrendously damaging toxic chemical spill in Colorado recently. The Washington Times reported that tribal leaders say the Obama Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to cheat Navajo Indians by convincing them to sign away rights to future claims following the agency's Gold King Mine disaster. These charges are only magnifying the White House's public relations problems following the toxic spill, which threatens to disrupt critical waterways in the Southwest for many years to come. Within days of the disaster, EPA officials began going door to door asking Navajos some of whom do not speak English as their primary language to sign a form offering to pay them some damages they have incurred from the spill so far. Signing the document waives any rights to return with new claims in the future if costs spiral higher than expected or if they encounter new, currently unforeseen fallout, Navajo President Russell Begaye told The Washington Times . 'It is underhanded. They're just trying to protect their pocketbook,' he told the paper in a telephone interview. Standard federal practice: Cheat those who have been wronged Begaye promised he would file suit on behalf of the Navajo Nation. He also said he suspected that the EPA was attempting to buy off as many of his people as possible now to ward off any larger settlement expenses in the future. As we previously reported , the toxic spill unleashed as much as three million gallons of heavily contaminated yellow-orange water into the Animas River, which feeds into the San Juan River and eventually the Colorado River. The tributaries provide water for cattle and crops in much of the Four Corners area, which is the nexus of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The Navajo Nation encompasses a great deal of that area. While the EPA had not officially responded to a Times inquiry regarding the pending suit, the agency's chief, Gina McCarthy, described the spill as 'heartbreaking' at a press conference in Durango, Colorado. She pledged to work with tribal leaders to control and manage the spill. 'We want everything to be transparent,' she said, despite the fact that the agency grossly underestimated the size of the spill , initially claiming that only about one million gallons of toxic water had escaped through a breached dam. As for the EPA agents trolling the Navajo Nation for early settlements, McCarthy said they were merely following the regular federal claims process, which means that throughout the government, Uncle Sam's standard practice is to shortchange people who have been harmed by careless federal actions. 'May cause forfeiture of your rights' Some lawmakers have pledged to look into the process. Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said via a spokeswoman that his office has fielded complaints from Navajo Nation and that his panel plans to look into the entire disaster. 'Chairman Bishop is outraged at the reports that the EPA is asking tribal members to sacrifice their rights after EPA's ineptitude has potentially threatened their health and livelihoods,' spokeswoman Julia Bell Slingsby said. 'People are suffering because of EPA negligence, and yet the federal government's response is not to help, but to engage in grasping for legal cover before the full extent of damage is known to Navajo farmers.' Slingsby added that the EPA would severely punish any private party or corporation that attempted to do the same thing, and she demanded to know why the Department of the Interior which holds oversight over Native American affairs has yet to come to the tribes' aid. The Times further reported: The claim forms EPA officials were distributing on the Navajo reservation ask locals to estimate a dollar amount they can attribute to property damage, personal injury or wrongful death. The form warns that failing to total up the claim 'may cause forfeiture of your rights.' Sources include: WashingtonTimes.com selfnews.com HNGN.com \n",
      " If you plan on going to a teaching hospital for a test or elective procedure, here's a warning that could save your life: Stay away from the hospital in July. The reason? According to a new study headed by Dr. David Phillips and Gwendolyn Barker from the University of California, San Diego, fatal medication errors soar that month -- especially in teaching hospitals. The research team investigated the cause behind the so-called curious 'July Effect' that has long been noted to worsen the outcomes of patients being treated in teaching hospitals during the month of July. Phillips and Barker focused on 244,388 U.S. death certificates issued between 1979 and 2006 that listed fatal medication errors as the primary cause of death. Then they compared the number of deaths that occurred in July with the number of expected events in a given month for a given year. Next, they looked to see if there were any differences between deaths in and out of hospitals in July and in counties that had or lacked teaching hospitals. The research, which was just published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine , found a clear association between inexperienced physicians and deadly medical errors. Specifically, the spike in hospital deaths each year from medication mistakes (such as accidental overdoses, wrong drugs given, and accidents in the use of drugs during medical and surgical procedures) in July coincided exactly with the annual influx of thousands of rookie doctors who begin their medical residencies and take on responsibility for patient care that month. This July peak in fatal drug errors was seen only in counties with teaching hospitals. In fact, the greater the concentration of teaching hospitals in a region, the greater the July spike in deaths. This was no little insignificant blip in the number of fatal physician screw-ups, either. The number of July deaths from medication mistakes linked to new doctors was a full 10 percent higher than the expected level. 'Our findings provide fresh evidence for 1. re-evaluating responsibilities assigned to new residents; 2. increasing supervision of new residents; 3. increasing education concerned with medication safety,' the authors of the study concluded. 'Incorporating these changes might reduce both fatal and non-fatal medication errors and thereby reduce the substantial costs associated with these errors.'

      " With health fears over reports resulting from consuming artificial sweeteners, most people looking for a zero calorie sugar substitute have been left wanting -- until now. It's not that safe, natural, low-calorie sugar substitutes were unavailable, just that the public doesn't know much about them. There are actually several delicious natural sugar substitutes that can take the place of any artificial sweetener -- even in baking -- and one surprise that makes them all taste even better. And the best part is most have no worrisome side effects. Stevia Stevia is the darling of the zero-calorie sugar substitutes, with good reason. It's totally natural, plant based, has no calories at all, 40 times sweeter than sugar, won't cause spikes in blood sugar levels and has no discernible side effects. Stevia caught on slowly due to initially having a bitter aftertaste; however, manufacturers of stevia products have started using the sweeter parts of the stevia plant to reduce the bitterness, making it more palatable. Because stevia is so much sweeter than sugar, it's difficult to use in baking. Stevia has not been approved by the FDA at the time of this article, due mainly to the strong lobbying efforts to keep it off the market by the American sugar corporations. Xylitol Xylitol is found naturally in certain fruits, vegetables, and corn cobs and is also a byproduct of animal metabolism. It's been reported that it may help strengthen the immune system and slow aging. Additionally, it contains antibacterial properties and is approved by the FDA. Xylitol has 9 calories per teaspoon and can be used in cooking and baking -- but please use non-GMO products. Substitute it for half the amount of sugar called for in a recipe. It protects against the formation of dental cavities, because the bacteria in the mouth do not form acids that attack tooth enamel like they do in combination with refined sugar. Because it will not cause fermentation, xylitol helps fight candida, preventing yeast infections. The one down side of eating xylitol is that too much can cause gas, diarrhea and bloating. Luo Han Guo Luo Han Guo is a sweet fruit found in China whose extract is used as a sugar substitute. Momordica grosvenori, the fruit yielding Luo han guo extract is a type of cucumber squash. The sweetening agents are called mogrosides and are available in powder form, which are about 250% sweeter than sugar. The product is stable and can be used in cooking and baking. One half teaspoon of Luo han guo has the equivalent sweetness of 25 teaspoons of sugar and less than 1 calorie. It has been used medicinally in China for hundreds of years to ease gastrointestinal ailments and respiratory conditions. It helps stabilize blood sugar and it has no known side effects. Salt Not a natural sugar substitute, but a natural flavor enhancer, salt is recommended by Alton Brown of the Food Network as a complement to sweet foods. Used in moderation, a sprinkle of salt brings out the sweetness or any natural sweetener or sugar substitute; and, salt removes any bitterness that may linger in foods. \n",
      " At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

      " Bill Nye, 'the science guy,' has a word of advice for those who cherish life he believes there should be no laws protecting life or property because 'you can't tell people what to do.' In a new video, Bill Nye defends Planned Parenthood and the illegal sale of organs harvested meticulously from the wombs of women and sold to biotech companies. Women deserve to be given better choices and treated with greater dignity. They don't deserve to have their emotions and bodies abused, while their next of kin is harvested from them and sold. In the video, Bill Nye reasons that abortion should remain legally convenient and taxpayer-funded because there's no way of stopping people from doing what they want. 'Nobody likes abortion but you can't tell somebody what to do. She has rights over this,' he said. With this kind of misguided reasoning, Bill Nye apparently believes that people have the right to hurt other people, because 'you can't tell them what to do.' In Bill Nye's world, public policy should expedite violence, encourage harm and make organ harvesting seem normal. There is no moral standard in his eyes, no mercy and no justice. He is literally advocating a more violent world. Since 'you can't tell people what to do' anyway, they can always rape, kill or destroy each other's property. Bill Nye doesn't care. He doesn't believe in the rule of law. To Nye, it doesn't matter if science can measure a beating heart by ultrasound at 6 weeks gestation. He doesn't care if the fetus is viable and capable of living outside the womb at 24 weeks. It doesn't matter if life has been conceived at all, fully capable of going full term with his/her own unique DNA from two parents. It doesn't matter if Planned Parenthood pathologists crack the skull of a living fetus and harvest organs to sell to a biotech company. He thinks 'We have so many more important things to be dealing with.' His lack of sensitivity toward human life and utter disregard for the rule of law are exactly why humanity is suffering today. Nye thinks that there should be no definition of personhood and no line drawn to protect the most vulnerable among us. Instead, he attacks Christians and Jews for their dedication to Biblical principles. He stereotypes anyone who cherishes life and distorts their beliefs by saying, 'I'm sorry guys. Your interpretation of a book written 5000 years ago... makes you think that when a man and a woman have sexual intercourse they always have a baby. That's wrong. So to pass laws based on that belief is inconsistent with nature.' He proudly states that the pro-life position is based on a 'deep scientific lack of understanding.' 'You cannot help but notice... you have a lot of men of European descent passing all these extraordinary laws based on ignorance,' he said. 'You apparently literally don't know what you are talking about,' he said. Since the 1970s, over 56.66 million fetuses have been sacrificed, never getting a chance to even become viable outside the womb, let alone grow into fully formed infants, children and adults. Abortion has become so accessible and so convenient, but Bill Nye would rather deflect from the heart of the matter. 'Many, many, many more hundreds of eggs are fertilized than become humans,' he says, because not all of those eggs will attach to a woman's uterine wall and result in pregnancy. 'But if you're going to hold that as a standard that life begins at conception and any egg that's fertilized has the same rights as an individual well, whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison?' he asks. 'Every woman who has had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy whose sperm has fertilized an egg and then it didn't become a human?' In reality, cherishing life is NOT about 'telling people what to do.' Cherishing life is NOT about jailing women for abortions and condemning their past decisions. Cherishing life is about working together to encourage healthy relationships and responsible reproductive decisions. It's about bringing more options to the forefront so care is encouraged for the most vulnerable in the womb. Cherishing life is about the responsibility of reproduction. It's about encouraging healthy relationships. As long as the illegal trafficking of fetal organs continues at Planned Parenthood, women won't be empowered. They will be misled and coerced into abortions that affect them on an emotional level for years to come. As Bill Nye and Planned Parenthood cling to their ego, with no hope for humanity, a growing number of people are learning that there are better ways available that treat women, men and the most vulnerable in society with utmost dignity, love and care.

      " Tweet (NewsTarget) According to new research published in the October issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, patients with high cholesterol who are taking high-dose statin drugs may be able to reduce the effects on their hearts by supplementing their diets with foods rich in plant sterols. High cholesterol -- hypercholesterolaemia -- has strong links to cardiovascular disease, which causes nearly 50 percent of deaths in Europe, and costs the EU roughly $202 billion each year. Previous studies have suggested that patients with high cholesterol can reduce their cholesterol levels by 8 to 17 percent by consuming 1.5 to 3 grams of plant sterols or stanols every day, which translates to a reduction in the risk of heart disease. Researchers from the University Medical Centre Utrecht and the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands studied 20 hypercholesterolaemic patients who were receiving a daily maximum dose of statin drugs -- atorvastatin or simvastatin, 80 mg. The randomized, single-blind study split the participants into two groups: the first received 3 grams of plant stanol-enriched margarine per day (Johnson & Johnson brand Benecol) for six weeks, and the second group received stanol-free margarine each day for six weeks. Both margarines contained the same amount of fat -- 62 percent. At the end of the six-week trial, the group given stanol-enriched margarine experienced a 9.9 percent reduction in plasma cholesterol and a 15.6 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol, while levels of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) -- which is responsible for transporting cholesterol to tissues -- fell by 10.8 percent. Conversely, the control group only experienced a 7.7 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol levels. Total cholesterol remained the same, and ApoB levels fell by 6.8 percent. 'Intensive dietary intervention with addition of plant stanols results in clinically relevant reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients optimally treated with statins, compared with similar patients on statins receiving only standard care,' the researchers wrote. However, consumer health advocate Mike Adams, author of 'Grocery Warning,' says this research should indicate to patients that plant stanols and sterols can actually replace statin drugs. 'Statin drugs are dangerous chemicals that can produce extremely harmful -- even fatal -- side effects,' Adams said. 'Replacing them with plant-based medicines under the care of a naturopathic physician can greatly improve the health of patients while greatly reducing the cost of their treatment.' ### \n",
      " Steve Jobs shrouded his treatment choices in secrecy while struggling with the pancreatic cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004. His secrecy was tight enough to annoy Apple executives. A top Apple director, Jerry York, was quoted off the record saying that he was so displeased with Jobs's lack of transparency regarding his illness that he had nearly resigned from the board over the matter. York's off the record status was removed after his death in 2010. But this 'lack of transparency' was frustrating to Apple directors and executives running a multi-billion dollar enterprise while Steve would go on leaves of absence to attempt different treatments secretly and then return only to go off secretly again. And that was just the kind of activity from a prominent pubic figure that promoted rumors and medical mafia-fueled media misinformation that once again was used to malign alternative cancer treatments. What is known about Steve Jobs' cancer and treatments The type of pancreatic cancer diagnosed for Job was a rare but less virulent form known as neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors, which manifest from the cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. It's considered treatable with early surgery, which Job underwent shortly after the diagnosis. What was publicized, however, was Steve's reluctance to surgery and his preference for a curative diet instead. Never mind the fact that he indeed had tumors surgically removed from his pancreas in 2004, shortly after his diagnosis. The media focus was on his preference for an undisclosed dietary approach and that he was a vegetarian. All that means is that he didn't eat meat. How much processed foods and sugars he consumed is unknown. But right away, the shadow was cast on healthy dietary approaches. This misinformation was used to pontificate about how Steve blew it by not undergoing conventional treatments immediately, even though he did! Another treatment Jobs underwent was disclosed after his demise. It was an unusual approach by a Swiss medical center that's not available in the USA. It's a special form of hormone-delivered radiotherapy (radiation) developed by the University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland. Though unique, it's a variation of orthodox oncology that mainstream media incorrectly label 'alternative.' Jobs had secretly visited the Swiss hospital around 2009. But shortly after that, in the same year, he underwent an unpublicized controversial liver transplant in a Memphis, Tennessee, hospital. Evidently, the cancer had spread to his liver. Steve Jobs was advised to enroll in more than one liver transplant waiting list. Tennessee has a short list. Multiple enrollments are considered legal, but only the extremely well-off can manage it. This gives billionaires unfair advantages. Even shadier, Steve owned a large, expensive house in Memphis, controlled by one of his LLCs (limited liability companies). And during Jobs' last two years, the surgeon who performed the transplant lived there while he was going through divorce proceedings, with the LLC attorneys paying all the large utility bills and high real estate taxes that whole time. The surgeon, Dr. James Eason, has not commented on whether he actually paid rent during those two years, but he did manage to purchase the home from the LLC at below market value after Steve passed away. Dr. Eason maintains that Steve Jobs was the most needy candidate for a liver transplant on their list. But some medical experts and journalists suggest conflicts of interest involving the treasured, large house. Many surgeons consider liver transplants for cancer patients as wasting donor organs. Also, the immune system issues with a strange new organ and use of immunosuppressive drugs to allow transplants create a bigger burden for a cancer patient's immune system. Steve passed away two years later, months after his last orthodox oncology attempt with chemotherapy at the Stanford Cancer Center in Palo Alto, California. Little of Steve's chemotherapy was mentioned by mainstream media, but Mike Adams was all over it here ( http://www.selfnews.com ). \n",
      " Tweet Losing a modest amount of weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity reduces the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) in women with prediabetes, a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not yet diabetic. This finding comes from a new study, published in the February issue of Diabetes Care, of women who participated in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a landmark clinical study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Launched in 1995, the DPPs main results were announced in 2001 and reported in 2002 (http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/feb2002/hhs-06.htm): losing 5 to 7 percent of weight through diet and a consistent increase in physical activity (e.g., walking 5 days a week 30 minutes a day) reduced the onset of type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. Treatment with metformin lowered the chances of developing diabetes by 31 percent. To combat the dual epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes, Americans need to know about the proven benefits of losing some weight through calorie reduction and increased physical activity, said NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. The DPP randomly assigned 3,234 overweight people with higher-than-normal blood glucose levels to one of three approaches to prevent type 2 diabetes: dietary changes and increased physical activity aimed at a 7-percent weight loss; treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin; or placebo. The last two groups were also given standard medical advice about diet and weight loss. In the study, 660 women were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle changes, 636 to metformin treatment, and 661 to placebo. Their average age was 50 years old, with an average body mass index of 35 (e.g., a 5 4 woman weighing 204 pounds). Women who implemented intensive lifestyle changes and lost 5 to 7 percent of their weight had fewer episodes of weekly incontinence compared to those in the metformin or placebo groups (38 percent vs. 48 percent vs. 46 percent, respectively.) Our findings reinforce the DPPs good news about the benefits of modest weight loss. A 200-pound woman who loses 10 to 15 pounds not only lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes but also improves bladder control, said lead author Jeanette S. Brown, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco. If youre a woman at risk for type 2 diabetes, preventing or delaying diabetes and improving bladder control are powerful reasons to make these lifestyle changes. Weight loss was particularly effective in reducing episodes of stress incontinence leakage of small amounts of urine during physical movement, such as coughing, sneezing, and exercising. Stress incontinence results, in large part, from a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Though researchers do not fully understand all the factors contributing to stress incontinence, it is linked to obesity, diabetes, and other conditions, such as pregnancy, which increase pressure on the pelvic floor. In the DPP participants, weight loss did not alleviate urge incontinence leakage of urine at unexpected times. Urge incontinence is more closely linked to overactive nerves that control the bladder, sometimes triggering inappropriate contractions. More than 13 million people in the United States, mostly middle-aged and older women, experience loss of bladder control. Overweight women and those with type 2 diabetes have a 50- to 70-percent increased risk of incontinence. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2002 sample, one out of three women with diabetes or prediabetic glucose levels reported weekly or more frequent episodes of UI. Some studies have reported that increased physical activity worsens incontinence, but DPP participants randomly assigned to lifestyle changes, who typically chose walking as their physical activity, did not have increased problems with incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a costly, socially isolating condition that impairs quality of life and takes a psychological toll on many women. For women at risk for type 2 diabetes, losing a modest amount of weight is likely to alleviate incontinence, especially stress incontinence, said Leroy Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), which funded the study. Nearly 21 million people in the United States 7 percent of the population have diabetes, the most common cause of blindness, kidney failure, and amputations in adults and a major cause of heart disease and stroke. Type 2 diabetes accounts for up to 95 percent of all diabetes cases. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in the last 30 years, due mostly to the upsurge in obesity. In addition, about 40 percent of U.S. adults ages 40 to 74 41 million people have prediabetes, which raises the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The NIDDK funds a great deal of research to improve the treatment and prevention of diabetes and urologic disorders. These efforts include the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (http://www.uitn.net/) and the Specialized Center of Research on Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction in women, a multidisciplinary translational research center at the University of California, San Francisco (http://www.ucsf.edu/scor). Recently, NIDDKs Central Repository (https://www.niddkrepository.org), which houses data collected in large clinical trials funded by the Institute, made data from the DPP available to researchers free of charge. The NIDDK also sponsors 'Let's Talk about Bladder Control for Women,' a campaign to inform women about treatments for incontinence, from pelvic floor exercises to surgery.

The National Diabetes Education Program (http://www.ndep.nih.gov/), jointly sponsored by the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 200 partner organizations, is disseminating the DPPs good news through its education campaign, 'Small Steps. Big Rewards. Prevent type 2 diabetes.'

      " Tweet (NewsTarget) A recent study from Pennsylvania State University utilized hidden ingredients in recipes, aimed at lowering calorie content, and evaluated participants' responses to the hidden ingredients. Researchers used hidden pureed vegetables to decrease calorie content in meals in order to determine if participants would feel satisfied with the lower calorie intake. Vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber and nutrients leading to satiation and weight loss. Although weight loss was not a factor in this study, other studies have found positive association with increased vegetable intake and subsequent weight loss. In the study conducted at Pennsylvania State University participants were assigned to three different groups. Food intake was controlled by weight so all groups consumed the same volume of food. In the groups receiving pureed vegetables, one was designed with about 200 less calories and the other group had 357 fewer calories. Even though weight loss was not a factor in this study, a reduction of nearly 360 calories per day could lead to a loss of about one pound every 10 days. The important aspect of the study was the satiation of the subjects and whether or not they enjoyed the food with pureed vegetables. In the survey all participants reported that they enjoyed the taste of the food regardless of whether or not they could taste the pureed vegetables. Despite the lowered calorie intake, all participants reported that they felt satisfied by the meals they were served. The researchers concluded that adding a significant amount of vegetables in the diet can lead to lower overall calorie intake. Decreasing calorie density of meals by adding nutrient rich vegetables is a healthy way to approach weight management without compromising satiety. A study published in the International Journal of Obesity looked at over 74,000 women and found those with the largest increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables had a 24% lower risk of obesity. Another 10 year follow up study from Spain found that increased fruit and vegetable consumption was significantly associated with a lower risk of medium weight gain. The researchers in this study concluded that increased fruit and vegetable intake should be vigorously promoted to prevent obesity. The biggest obstacle to increasing fruit and vegetable intake is not the knowledge of their efficacy in improved health and weight loss ; it is the fact that Americans simply refuse to do so. Richard Mattes Professor of Foods and Nutrition at Purdue University observed: in several unrelated but similar studies, even though participants lost weight they claimed they would not continue the diet at home. The reasons they stated were that they would not spend the money on the vegetables nor would they spend the time to prepare them. Utilizing the calorie reducing power of vegetable purees is simple. Pureed steamed cauliflower can be used in cream sauces; pureed carrots can be used in tomato based sauces; and green leafy vegetables can be pureed in soups, stews, and smoothies. The key to successful weight loss is to decrease calorie density by adding more fruits and vegetables in the diet while decreasing consumption of processed calorie laden foods. The studies available offer excellent insight into the dietary changes necessary to combat obesity; it is merely the choice of the individual whether or not this knowledge will create change.

      " Is disgraced NBC News anchor Brian Williams about to drop a dime on others in his industry who might have 'fabricated' stories or otherwise embellished during the recounting of their news coverage? It seems possible in light of a threat issued by the 55-year-old anchor to make his departure from the network 'really ugly,' say reports. Britain's Daily Mail noted that Williams is refusing to go down 'without a fight' as he angles for a return to his nightly news reader desk, a source close to the network told the paper. The threats come on the heels of an internal inquiry report that found that Williams had lied repeatedly - at least 11 times - to make himself appear to be something he is not or was not. Williams was suspended from his anchor chair with no pay for six months in February after it was revealed that he provided false details regarding his presence aboard a U.S. military helicopter during the earliest days of the Iraq invasion. Williams said his chopper was hit by RPG fire over Iraq, which was patently untrue. Does Williams have the goods on other network liars? A source who is allegedly close to NBC News told the New York Post 's 'Page Six' that he 'is saying he's not going down without a fight and [is] threatening to make it really ugly - worse than Ann Curry.' Curry departed the network's Today show in 2013 amid an outpouring of negative publicity. As the Post noted, Curry made a teary-eyed, emotional on-air good-by as her co-host, Matt Lauer, looked on sheepishly. The Post further noted that both Curry and Williams are represented by 'pit bull lawyer' Williams & Connolly's Bob Barnett. 'They want Brian to resign,' said one source. 'If they have to fire him, they can't control him.' The rising tension between Williams and parent company NBCUniversal has become more evident lately. On April 24, NBC released its internal probe, which found the additional instances of Williams' embellishment. Three days later, the Post said, a report that was positive towards Williams just happened to surface stating that NBC News chief Andy Lack was looking for a way to save the disgraced anchor's job. However, days later, anti-Williams factions indicated to The Hollywood Reporter that Lack is not sure he can keep Williams or that the anchor will ever return. In Williams' absence, Lester Holt has been anchoring NBC Nightly News . The Post further reported that there is no question there is increasing urgency within NBCUniversal management ranks to get past the Williams episode, in large part because the nightly newscast's ratings are tanking. 'No one is speaking out in his defense.' ABC World News Tonight , which is hosted by David Muir, announced recently that it led NBC Nightly News in total viewers during the previous four weeks, which was the first time that had happened in years. In addition, ABC also won the key 25-to-54-year-old demographic for three straight weeks; that is the primary demographic sought by advertisers. NBC is ahead for the season so far, but clearly its market share is falling, and that is likely tied to the Williams disaster. The Post further noted: 'As talks between Williams and Comcast's NBCUniversal unit heat up, Williams is believed to be trying to ensure that he is entitled to a payout under the five-year, $10 million-per-year deal he signed last year .' 'They are not going to give him an opportunity to do an Ann Curry,' said a source familiar with news management. In addition, former Meet the Press anchor David Gregory has been kept off the air to prevent him from making any on-air remarks regarding Williams' departure. 'NBC seems intent on damaging him,' said a friend of Williams. 'No one is speaking out in his defense.'

      " Recently Senator Charles Grassley, ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has been looking into financial ties between the pharmaceutical industry and the academic physicians who largely determine the market value of prescription drugs. He hasn't had to look very hard. (Story by Marcia Angell, republished from NYBooks.com ) Take the case of Dr. Joseph L. Biederman, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and chief of pediatric psychopharmacology at Harvard's Massachusetts General Hospital. Thanks largely to him, children as young as two years old are now being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with a cocktail of powerful drugs, many of which were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose and none of which were approved for children below ten years of age. Legally, physicians may use drugs that have already been approved for a particular purpose for any other purpose they choose, but such use should be based on good published scientific evidence. That seems not to be the case here. Biederman's own studies of the drugs he advocates to treat childhood bipolar disorder were, as The New York Times summarized the opinions of its expert sources, 'so small and loosely designed that they were largely inconclusive.' In June, Senator Grassley revealed that drug companies , including those that make drugs he advocates for childhood bipolar disorder, had paid Biederman $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees between 2000 and 2007. Two of his colleagues received similar amounts. After the revelation, the president of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the chairman of its physician organization sent a letter to the hospital's physicians expressing not shock over the enormity of the conflicts of interest, but sympathy for the beneficiaries: 'We know this is an incredibly painful time for these doctors and their families, and our hearts go out to them.' Or consider Dr. Alan F. Schatzberg, chair of Stanford's psychiatry department and president-elect of the American Psychiatric Association. Senator Grassley found that Schatzberg controlled more than $6 million worth of stock in Corcept Therapeutics, a company he cofounded that is testing mifepristone--the abortion drug otherwise known as RU-486--as a treatment for psychotic depression. At the same time, Schatzberg was the principal investigator on a National Institute of Mental Health grant that included research on mifepristone for this use and he was coauthor of three papers on the subject. In a statement released in late June, Stanford professed to see nothing amiss in this arrangement, although a month later, the university's counsel announced that it was temporarily replacing Schatzberg as principal investigator 'to eliminate any misunderstanding.' Perhaps the most egregious case exposed so far by Senator Grassley is that of Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff, chair of Emory University's department of psychiatry and, along with Schatzberg, coeditor of the influential Textbook of Psychopharmacology. Nemeroff was the principal investigator on a five-year $3.95 million National Institute of Mental Health grant--of which $1.35 million went to Emory for overhead--to study several drugs made by GlaxoSmithKline. To comply with university and government regulations, he was required to disclose to Emory income from GlaxoSmithKline, and Emory was required to report amounts over $10,000 per year to the National Institutes of Health, along with assurances that the conflict of interest would be managed or eliminated. But according to Senator Grassley, who compared Emory's records with those from the company, Nemeroff failed to disclose approximately $500,000 he received from GlaxoSmithKline for giving dozens of talks promoting the company's drugs. In June 2004, a year into the grant, Emory conducted its own investigation of Nemeroff's activities, and found multiple violations of its policies. Nemeroff responded by assuring Emory in a memorandum, 'In view of the NIMH/Emory/GSK grant, I shall limit my consulting to GSK to under $10,000/year and I have informed GSK of this policy.' Yet that same year, he received $171,031 from the company, while he reported to Emory just $9,999--a dollar shy of the $10,000 threshold for reporting to the National Institutes of Health. Emory benefited from Nemeroff's grants and other activities, and that raises the question of whether its lax oversight was influenced by its own conflicts of interest. As reported by Gardiner Harris in The New York Times , Nemeroff himself had pointed out his value to Emory in a 2000 letter to the dean of the medical school, in which he justified his membership on a dozen corporate advisory boards by saying: Surely you remember that Smith-Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals donated an endowed chair to the department and there is some reasonable likelihood that Janssen Pharmaceuticals will do so as well. In addition, Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals has funded a Research Career Development Award program in the department, and I have asked both AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Meyers [sic] Squibb to do the same. Part of the rationale for their funding our faculty in such a manner would be my service on these boards. Read the entire article at NYBooks.com . \n",
      " The Obama administration and its gun-grabbing allies in Congress are planning to exploit the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in a renewed bid to take away guns and gun rights. But in the days following the massacre of 20 first graders and six adults, the Gallup polling firm found that, by overwhelming majorities, most citizens favor decidedly different solutions to prevent further senseless attacks on our nation's schools. According to the survey, the most popular option chosen by respondents is boosting police presence at schools; 53 percent of respondents said more police would be 'very effective' at reducing acts of mass murder, while another 34 percent said it would be 'somewhat effective.' In addition to boosting protective measures, Americans also believe that increasing funding and access to mental health services would be an effective deterrent. The Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, was reportedly afflicted with mental issues; so was the Aurora, Colo., shooter, James Holmes. Fully half of respondents - 50 percent - said more mental health access and funding would be 'very effective' at reducing future violence, with an additional 34 percent saying such measures would be 'somewhat effective.' Only 14 percent said they believed more funding would not be effective. Arm the educators Americans also believe that there is far too much violence depicted on television and in video games to which kids are exposed. 47 percent of respondents said reducing depictions of gun violence in movies, on television and in video games would go a long way towards reducing real-life violence; 31 percent said doing so would be 'somewhat effective.' What is especially noteworthy; however, is the number of Americans who believe that arming school personnel would be an effective deterrent; fully 64 percent believe allowing education professionals to be armed would be a 'very effective' or 'somewhat effective' step. It's this latter idea that is catching on in a number of public policy and law enforcement circles. Just days after the Sandy Hook shooting, St. Louis County Police Chief Tom Fitch stated plainly that educators and education professionals should be trained to carry weapons and armed while in school, to protect kids. 'We can talk on the back end of the need for funding of mental illness programs and gun control, but as a law enforcement officer, I'm focused on that five-minute window that it takes for the cops to get there while people are getting killed,' he said. 'There is somebody out there right now trying to figure out how to do something worse than this guy did, and there is only one way to end a threat, and that's with lethal force.' 'We cannot continue to do things as we've always done it, that's why we need to have frank discussion in this country as to where we go from here,' he added. At this point, denial has become our most dangerous enemy Knee-jerk reactionaries; however, quickly dismissed his suggestion and illogical, unworkable, foolish - you name it - but Fitch, a career law enforcement officer, remained undeterred, mostly because he has yet to hear a better idea. 'How do you think we should respond to that?' he said during an interview on local radio station KMOX , regarding the lag time when shots are first fired to when police arrive. 'Nobody has an answer. Nobody has said, 'well, I would do this.' They just say, 'I don't like what you said, it's unacceptable, it's irresponsible, you should be fired.' I've heard all of that. But, nobody has an answer for that critical time period.' He's not alone. Other law enforcement and security experts have similar sentiments. In an excerpt from a compelling article posted online at PoliceOne.com , featuring a hard-hitting presentation on school security by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, the solution is laid bare: The challenge for law enforcement agencies and officers, then, is to overcome not only the attacks taking place in schools, but to first overcome the denial in the minds of mayors, city councils, school administrators, and parents. Grossman said that agencies and officers, although facing an uphill slog against the denial of the general public, must diligently work toward increasing understanding among the sheep that the wolves are coming for their children. Police officers must train and drill with teachers, not only so responding officers are intimately familiar with the facilities, but so that teachers know what they can do in the event of an attack.

      " Many nations formerly of the under-developed Global South, are not about to be bullied by rich Global North countries that have long since existed on the cutting edge of industry and technology and you can count India as one of the largest. In recent days, world leaders and concerned interests gathered in Paris to discuss so-called 'global warming' issues in the latest push to adopt enforceable limits on carbon emissions that are generated primarily through the burning of fossil fuels. India like China, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries is currently in the midst of economic expansions much like the United States and Europe experienced a hundred years ago using much of the same affordable carbon-producing technology that these emerging economies are now relying on. And while the U.S. and Europe have adopted unreasonable and expensive carbon reduction standards which have been based primarily on phony science and manipulated climate data countries like India are not about to surrender their economies just when they are beginning to explode, despite very real health concerns caused by heavy industrialization. 'Carbon imperialism' During the Paris confab, Secretary of State John Kerry even went so far as to single out India as a 'challenge' meaning it would be difficult, at best, to get New Delhi to agree to restrictive new carbon emissions reductions and, from the sound of it, he's right. As the UK Telegraph reported, India indeed has a problem with smog, especially in its large cities, but the country's people and leadership appear to have accepted it as part of the price of modernity and economic growth: It's rush hour in the world's most polluted city, and just visible through the dense blanket of smog is an electronic billboard informing motorists that the air quality has dropped from 'very poor' to 'severe'. If this were Beijing an emergency would be declared, with schools closed for the day and production at factories halted. But here in Delhi, judging by faces barely visible behind anti-pollution masks, nobody seems to have noticed. ... Faced with a rapidly growing population, a buoyant but fragile economy blighted by constant power shortages and millions still living in abject poverty, India argues that it cannot simply decide between renewable and non-renewable power - it needs both. When Kerry singled out India as a 'challenge,' his insult was met with an appropriate mix of anger, frustration and incredulity. 'Kerry's comment is unwarranted and unfair. The attitude of some of the developed countries is the challenge for the Paris conclusion,' said Prakash Javadekar, India's environment minister, The Telegraph reported. He added that his country is 'not in the habit of taking any pressure from anybody.' 'This smacks of a 'carbon imperialism',' Arvind Subramanian, the Indian government's chief economic advisor, also noted. 'And such imperialism on the part of advanced nations could spell disaster for India and other developing countries.' We aren't so good at clean energy policy, either They and others contend that India still burns less coal than the U.S. the world's No. 1 user and China, a rising second and that both have profited from burning carbon-producing fuels for decades (the U.S. for more than a century-and-a-half). But that doesn't mean India is wedded to coal . In fact, as The Telegraph reports further: India has announced efforts to boost renewables too. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a 'solar alliance' of 122 solar-rich countries at Paris, seeking to attract $100bn per year global investment in the technology. He has also spoken of the need for new, cleaner methods of coal generation. As for the U.S., our political leadership continually shoots our industries in the foot, even when it comes to so-called 'clean' energy technology. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton designed a huge area in Utah as a federal monument a land mass that just happened to contain a trillion dollars' worth of rare, 'clean' coal . As for the one source of energy that produces a lot of electric power with no emissions nuclear power it is nearly impossible to get a new plant approved, and the regulatory process makes them cost-prohibitive to build. In the meantime, nations like India aren't into the cult of 'global warming,' and are not about to be cowed into giving up the one cheap resource they need to feed and power a nation of 1 billion plus.

      " You may recall learning a little bit about medieval English feudalism while in World History class in school. It was a governing system introduced by William I, better known as William the Conqueror, in which he divided up land and gave it to 'nobles' who fought for him and did well in battle. In essence, those who lived on the noble's land were his vassals; in order to survive, they worked the noble's land for a meager living and owed allegiance to him as well. Feudalism has long since disappeared from Europe, but is it on the rebound in the United States? Perhaps, at least in an abbreviated form. Increasingly, because of a historically slow recovery from the economic fiasco of the Great Recession of 2008, more and more Americans have been forced to forego the lifelong dream of owning their own home and instead have been forced to rent. Much of the economic fall-out of the Great Recession came in the form of a collapse in the subprime mortgage industry, in which millions of Americans -- thanks to Clinton-era housing policies -- were permitted to 'buy' homes they simply could not afford. Banks played financial musical chairs with the subprime mortgages, packaging and repackaging them and selling to each other, until there were no buyers left for the worthless notes. The banks were rescued, but Americans were not As noted by McClatchy DC : In 2006 and 2007, Goldman Sachs Group peddled more than $40 billion in securities backed by at least 200,000 risky home mortgages, but never told the buyers it was secretly betting that a sharp drop in U.S. housing prices would send the value of those securities plummeting. In the aftermath, millions of Americans either lost homes or saw the homes they owned severely devalued, a condition that, in some parts of the country, continues to this day. As for the big banks that were forced to make the loans (remember, this was government policy), they got a bailout under the auspices that, if they did not, the global economy would collapse as well, leading to a massive recession. The result was that banks' bottom lines improved while Americans' bottom lines did not or, at least, not nearly as quickly, and not at all to the extent of the banks. And the housing market is still feeling the effects. As reported by the blog Wolf Street : The housing market has been healed by the Fed's bold actions, we're told incessantly. ... Prices have soared over the last three years, and in some cities, like San Francisco, they have soared far beyond the prior crazy bubble peak. So we admit grudgingly that the Fed's six-year money-printing and interest-rate-repression campaign, designed to inflate every asset price in sight even to absurdity, has worked. However, an essential element in a healthy housing market -- people who actually live in homes they own -- has been dissipating. The homeownership rate peaked in 2004 at 69.2%. It was during the prior housing bubble. Speculative buying drove up prices beyond the reach of many potential buyers. The American dream is collapsing Others note that the collapse of the American dream of homeownership is proceeding apace. According to the U.S. Census Bureau , [PDF] homeownership in the U.S. stood at 64 percent last year, a figure that was 1.2 percent lower than the previous year, the largest annual drop in the history of the data series going back to 1980. Younger households were hit the hardest, analysts noted. In the age group of homeowners under 35, the ownership rate plunged 1. 5 percent to 35.4 percent; for ages 35-44, the rate dropped even further, 2.1 percent -- and all in a single year -- to settle at 58.8 percent. These age groups are normally targeted as first-time home buyers. Will feudalism return to the United States? Maybe not quite in the same form as it existed in medieval Europe, but a form of it seems to be increasingly prevalent as more Americans are shut out of owning their own property and must instead exist dependent on the property of others.

      " A new report says that the number of illegal aliens currently residing in the United States has surpassed the number of unemployed Americans looking for work, a statistic that is bound to become a factor in the 2016 presidential race. As reported by the Washington Free Beacon , new data from the Pew Research Center found that there were approximately 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. in 2014, compared to 9.6 million American citizens who were unemployed in the same year. The Pew report, which utilized data from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, notes: An estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2014. The new unauthorized immigrant total includes people who cross the border illegally as well as those who arrive with legal visas and remain in the U.S. after their visas expire. Of the 11.3 million illegals, 8.1 million are currently participating in the labor force. 'Unauthorized immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force,' said the Pew report . 'In the U.S. labor force, there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants either working or looking for work in 2012.' Read more about unemployment in America at unemployment.fetch.news Issue will be a priority for many Americans in 2016 By 2014, the report states, 1.7 million more illegal immigrants were living in the country than there were jobless Americans. The BLS data indicate that the average number of unemployed Americans in 2014 was 9.6 million; the agency defines an unemployed person as someone who was without a job but who was actively searching for one in the previous four weeks. The WFB noted that President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigrants, which critics say amounted to an unconstitutional executive amnesty, that he enacted in November of 2014 will ultimately result in more illegal aliens becoming active in the U.S. labor force. 'Last year, President Barack Obama took executive action to expand an existing program and establish a new one that would offer work permits and deportation relief to an estimated 5 million unauthorized immigrants ,' the Pew report stated. 'The actionswhich are on hold because of a lawsuit by 26 stateswould be open to unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who are parents with a child who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident, as long as they meet certain requirements.' The Pew report noted that illegal immigration to the U.S. exploded between 1990, when there were about 3.5 million inside the country, and 2007, when the figure grew to more than 12 million. But the employment disparity is certain to garner attention, not only among the American electorate, but also from presidential candidates, some of whom have already made headlines criticizing Obama's immigration policies. 'You can't be talking about anything else' Billionaire real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump was the first to really broach the subject in a manner than rankled the political elite but nevertheless struck a chord with average Americans, judging by his meteoric rise to the top of Republican polls. When he launched his bid in July, Trump emphatically stated that a large number of aliens crossing illegally into the U.S. were criminals specifically 'rapists' and 'murderers' and that Mexico was not sending its best citizens. Less than a week after making his controversial comments, 32-year-old Kate Steinle of San Francisco was killed by a 45-year-old illegal alien from Mexico who had been deported five times and recently released from custody by San Francisco officials. Since then, Trump has elevated the topic of 'sanctuary cities' like San Francisco to the fore, calling such local policies dangerous and caused by an 'unsafe border.' Another top Republican candidate, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, has made standing up for American workers versus those who are in the country illegally part of his campaign. 'You can't be talking about anything else until you do that,' Walker said during a recent appearance on Fox News ' 'Hannity' program.

      " Tweet 412 BC Major epidemic of a disease (which, although not called influenza, probably was influenza) recorded by Hippocrates. 1357 AD The term, influenza, from the Italian word meaning 'influence,' was coined. Popular belief at that time blamed the development of flu on the influence of the stars. 1485 'Sweating sickness,' a flu-like malady, sickens hundreds of thousands of people in Britain. The Lord Mayor of London, his successor and six aldermen die. The Royal Navy cannot leave port due to the sickness of sailors. Doctors prescribe tobacco juice, lime juice, emetics, cathartics and bleeding as treatments for the disease. 1580 First recorded influenza pandemic begins in Europe and spreads to Asia and Africa. 1700s Influenza pandemics in 1729-1730, 1732-1733, 1781-1782. 1781 Major epidemic causing high mortality among the elderly spreads across Russia from Asia. 1830 Major epidemic causing high mortality among the elderly spreads across Russia from Asia. 1831, 1833-1834 Influenza pandemics hit. 1847-1848 Influenza sweeps through the Mediterranean to southern France and then continues across in Western Europe. 1878 A disease causing high mortality in poultry becomes known as the 'fowl plague.' Fowl plague is now called HPAI avian influenza. 1889-1890 The 'Russian flu' spreads through Europe and reaches North America in 1890. 1900 Major epidemic. 1918-1919 The 'Spanish Flu' circles the globe (though some experts think it may have started in the U.S.). Caused by an H1N1 flu virus, it is the worst influenza pandemic (and subsequently, epidemic) to date. There are more than half a million U.S. deaths; worldwide death estimates range from 20 million to 100 million. According to WebMD, 'The pandemic comes before the era of antibiotics -- which are now essential in treating the secondary bacterial infections that often kill flu-weakened patients -- so it's difficult to say whether this flu would have the same dreadful impact in the modern world. But it is a very frightening disease, with very high death rates among young, previously healthy adults.' 1924 The first outbreak of HPAI avian influenza -- bird flu -- in the U.S. It does not spread among humans. Late 1920s Richard Shope shows that swine influenza can be transmitted through filtered mucous, implying that influenza is caused by a virus. 1933 Sir Christopher Andrewes, Wilson Smith and Sir Patrick Laidlaw isolate the first human influenza virus. 1940 Frank Macfarlane Burnet grows influenza on a laboratory growth system (embryonated chicken eggs). 1941 George K. Hirst discovers that influenza causes hemagglutination of red blood cells, thus providing a new method of assaying for the virus 1955 Sir Christopher Andrewes, along with Burnet and Bang, coins the term 'myxovirus' for the influenza family. 1957-1958 The 'Asian Flu' causes the second pandemic of the 20th century. Caused by an H2N2 virus, it begins in China and kills one million people worldwide, including 70,000 Americans. 1968-1969 The 'Hong Kong Flu' causes the last flu pandemic. It was caused by an H3N2 virus and killed some 34,000 Americans. The relatively low death toll is thought to have been due to two factors. First, the virus contained the N2 protein humans had been exposed to before. Second, an H3 virus circulated around the turn of the century, giving some immune protection to elderly people who had caught the flu back then. Mid-1970s Researchers realize that enormous pools of influenza virus continuously circulate in wild birds. 1976 Swine flu breaks out among a handful of soldiers stationed at Fort Dix, N.J. One dies. It's an H1N1 virus, and health officials worry that they are seeing the return of the 1918 H1N1 Spanish Flu pandemic. As the virus is circulating among U.S. pigs, President Gerald Ford calls for a crash vaccination program. Despite delays, a vaccine is made and a quarter of the U.S. population is inoculated. There were 25 deaths from a rare paralytic complication of the vaccination (Guillain-Barre syndrome). Nobody else died of swine flu, which never caused an epidemic. 1977 Mild Russian influenza epidemic occurs. 1983 The second HPAI outbreak occurs in the U.S. Caused by an H5N2 virus, it does not spread among humans. However, this severe poultry epidemic strikes chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl in Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is finally brought under control after the destruction of 17 million birds. 1988 Wiley, Wilson and Skehel determine the location of the antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin molecule by X-ray crystallography. 1996 HPAI H5N1 bird flu is isolated from a farmed goose in Guangdong, China. May 1997 The first person known to catch H5N1 bird flu dies in Hong Kong. The virus has been causing an epidemic among poultry in the city. November-December 1997 There are 18 new human cases of H5N1 bird flu in Hong Kong, 12 with direct contact with infected poultry. Six people die. Officials destroy 1.4 million chickens and ducks. Jan. 5, 2003 Health authorities in Vietnam inform the WHO office in Hanoi of an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in 11 previously healthy children hospitalized in Hanoi, with the most recent hospital admission on Jan. 4. Seven cases were fatal and two patients remain critically ill. A 12th case, a sibling of one of the Hanoi cases, died of a respiratory illness in a provincial hospital. \n",
      " It's been a long time coming and, with the opposition party controlling both the Senate and Executive Branch, there is no guarantee of success, but one congressman is vowing to shutter the abusive Transportation Security Administration and allow airports the right to hire their own customer-friendly private security. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., head of an Oversight and Government Reform Committee sub-panel, has been perhaps the most consistent critic of the TSA. In addition to speaking out against some of the agency's outrageous screening practices, he has also lobbied airports to ditch the agency in lieu of private screeners. Now, he's prepared to take his crusade a step further: He wants to disband the TSA altogether. Mica says he will soon introduce legislation returning all airport security authority to private firms. In addition, he has stated he is determined to push for up to six hearings this year along to get the bill crafted and to the House floor. What's more, he believes ditching the agency is - or should be - a bipartisan effort. 'I'm telling you, whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or if there are a few independents left, people have had it right up to their eyebrows with TSA,' Mica told Bloomberg News . 'It's not a partisan issue.' Looking for a little payback? Admittedly, Mica wrote the legislation establishing the TSA in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but has regretted doing so ever since. He has proclaimed the agency a miserable failure, especially in the past few years. And more recently, the head of the agency, John Pistole, angered Mica even further when he refused to appear before the Florida lawmaker's committee, arrogantly proclaiming at the time that the panel has 'no jurisdiction over the TSA .' That was then. The panel Mica now chairs does have jurisdiction over the agency, as well as subpoena power (a power his previous panel lacked), and agency officials have no recourse but to appear if or when the panel requires them to do so. 'I have clear jurisdiction, investigative jurisdiction with subpoena power,' Mica said. 'I intend to use whatever it takes to get answers to try and change the agency.' Mica said his legislative effort has 'strong momentum,' and he adds that if passed the measure would return airport screening duties to private companies within two years. TSA 'should not be conducting the screening,' he said. 'They should be setting the standards, conducting the oversight. TSA should be a security and intelligence agency.' Mica's concept is not radical. Already there are 16 airports using private security companies under the Screening Partnership Program (SPP), and more are considering joining after years of TSA abuses - many of which have been captured on video and have gone viral - as well as passenger complaints. 'It's critical that TSA get out of the business of running a huge bureaucracy and human resources operation and refocus its attention on security, analyzing intelligence, and setting the highest risk-based security standards,' Mica - who has written to hundreds of airports encouraging them to opt for private security - has said. 'TSA needs to focus on going after terrorists - not little old ladies, veterans and children.' Mica has said. It won't be smooth sailing, but... Unfortunately, there are other obstacles to the passage of Mica's bill, if or when it reaches the House floor. A recent Government Accountability Office report, issued in December, noted there was 'insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions of improved performance of SPP...when compared to federal screening services' (though I would point out that no videos of outrageous behavior committed by SPP participants have been posted or have gone viral). That conclusion led Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security committee, to advise the TSA to stop accepting additional SPP applications from airports until further study can be done - a move which has already led to some airports backing away from considering joining the SPP. Nevertheless, Mica says he will call his first hearing in April to look at the TSA's dubious claim that sequester-forced spending cuts are going to cause longer delays in airports - though the agency just signed a $50 million contract to purchase new uniforms and is continuing to by unreliable but expensive body scanners.

      " Tweet (NewsTarget) U.S. newspaper publishers are shifting their focus away from print subscribers and toward the Internet as print advertising revenue continues to fall, according to presentations made at the annual Mid-Year Media Review, hosted by the Newspaper Association of America . 'The Internet is no longer an add-on,' said Reid Ashe, chief operating officer of Media General. 'For many applications such as breaking news or increasingly, classified advertising, it's now our primary medium.' Media General owns three metropolitan newspapers -- including the Tampa Tribune and Richmond Times Dispatch -- 22 daily community newspapers, 23 network-affiliated television stations and more than 150 other publications, such as weekly papers. In addition to these media outlets, Media General owns 75 affiliated online enterprises. Media General announced that it expects the profit from its print outlets to be lower in 2007 than 2006; the company's May revenues were 15% lower than its revenues from the same month last year. In contrast, it expects online revenue of $40 million for 2007, and $50 million for 2008. Belo Chairman and CEO Robert W. Decherd announced the Dallas Morning News will reduce its distribution to within 100 miles of Dallas/Fort Worth, in order to save $9 million per year, and that it is planning other circulation cutting measures as well. 'In actively marketing our products, the emphasis should be on attracting quality subscribers rather than seeking quantity at any cost,' Decherd said. 'Instead of focusing on short-term performance, our goal over time is to deliver a stable audience with a demographic profile that is very attractive to advertisers -- and do so in the most cost effective way possible.' However, the Internet may not be as much of a salvation as many have thought. While newspapers' online advertising revenue continues to grow, this growth has slowed -- 20 percent this year, compared to 30 or 35 percent a few years ago. According to the media news site followthemedia.com, this growth is not fast enough to offset declining print revenue. \n",
      " Drinking as little as one can of soda pop per day is enough to increase your risk of both type 2 diabetes and stroke by a significant percentage, according to a new study out of Europe. Based on an analysis involving about 27,000 people who were surveyed on their health and dietary habits, researchers determined that over the course of 16 years, those who drank just one soda a day were 18 percent more likely than others to either develop type 2 diabetes or suffer a stroke. Published in the journal Diabetologia , the study analyzed data on about 12,000 people who developed type 2 diabetes between 1991 and 2007, as well as data on a randomly selected group of roughly 15,000 people without the condition. Researchers then compared data they collected from a survey on soda consumption patterns among all the participants with their respective health outcomes, and adjusted these findings to take into account outside risk factors such as age, physical activity levels, body mass index (BMI) and total daily calorie intake. After refining the data in accordance with generally accepted standards, the research team determined that the risk factors for both type 2 diabetes and stroke jumped by nearly 20 percent over a 16-year period. These findings correspond with a similar study conducted in the U.S. several years ago that linked daily soda consumption with a 25 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 'In European men and women, one 12-ounce daily increment in sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with a 22 percent increase in hazard ratio [sic] for type 2 diabetes ,' wrote Dr. Dora Romaguera from Imperial College London and her colleagues from the InterAct consortium in their paper. This percentage was adjusted to 18 percent after taking into accounts BMI and caloric intake, according to FoodNavigator.com . '[This study] adds to a growing global literature suggesting that there is a link between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, obesity and risk of development of type 2 diabetes,' added Prof. Nick Wareham from the University of Cambridge , who also contributed to the study. 'Together with observations from randomized controlled trials, this observation suggests that consumption of these beverages should be limited as part of an overall healthy diet.' Diet soda consumption also linked to type 2 diabetes So-called 'sugar-sweetened' beverages were not the only processed beverages to be linked to diabetes, however. Based on data from the same survey, participants who drank artificially-sweetened beverages laced with chemicals like aspartame (Sweet'N Low) and sucralose (Splenda) were also found to have an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes compared to participants who drank no soda at all. According to another study published in the journal Diabetes Care , people who drink at least one can of diet soda a day have a 67 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to people who drink no soda at all. 'Zero-calorie' chemical sodas were also linked to significantly increasing the risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, a classification of risk factors linked to obesity that increase a person's risk of developing not only diabetes and stroke but also heart disease. 'Contrary to conventional thinking, the risk of diabetes is higher with 'light' beverages compared with 'regular' sweetened drinks,' said the National Institute of Health and Medical Research following the release of a French study earlier this year that also linked diet soda consumption to diabetes. \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) Eating a diet low in fat may reduce a woman's risk of breast cancer relapse, according to a study published on December 20 in the 'Journal of the National Cancer Institute.' Researchers studied 2,400 post-menopausal women who had been successfully treated for breast cancer, and monitored their condition for five years. The women had all previously received standard treatments for their cancer, including surgery, hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. One group of women was asked to consume less than 33 grams of fat per day 20 percent of their total calorie intake. The control group ate a standard diet of approximately 51 grams of fat per day, or 30 percent of their total daily calories. After five years, the relapse rate among those who had eaten the low-fat diet was 9.8 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the control group in other words, a 20 percent lower risk. The difference was statistically significant, said researchers. When the researchers divided the breast-cancer cases depending on whether or not the tumors contained receptors for estrogen hormones, a different pattern emerged. Among those with estrogen-receptor-negative tumors, women who ate the low-fat diet had a 41 percent lower risk of recurrence. Preliminary results suggested that this difference became even more drastic when the observation period was extended past five years. Among those with estrogen-receptor-positive tumors, however, a low-fat diet produced no statistically significant difference in relapse risk. The study could not determine the cause for the correlation between reduced fat intake and reduced risk. Prior studies have shown a correlation between obesity and breast cancer risk, such that gaining 22 pounds can increase person's risk of contracting breast cancer by 18 percent. The recurrence study called the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study was funded by the American Institute of Cancer Research. ### \n",
      " Slowly but surely, traditional American culture and values are being swept away by liberal, progressive activists and culture warriors who actively encourage a break from our past, even if they don't say so directly. The latest example of this dramatic cultural shift comes from coffee icon Starbucks, whose CEO and founder recently told customers and shareholders who happen to believe in the historical nature of marriage as a construct between one man and one woman to stay out of his stores. At the company's annual meeting in Seattle recently, CEO/founder Howard Schultz was challenged by a shareholder who questioned his well-publicized position of supporting gay marriage and last year's support of a referendum in Washington state backing same-sex marriages. Schultz's position led to calls to boycott Starbucks from the National Organization for Marriage, and the shareholder explained that led to lower-than-expected earnings. No tolerance for traditional points of view 'In the first full quarter after this boycott was announced, our sales and our earnings, shall we say politely, were a bit disappointing,' said the shareholder, Tom Strobhar, whom the Huffington Post identified as the founder of the anti-gay marriage group Corporate Morality Action Center. The criticism did not seem to affect Schultz. 'Not every decision is an economic decision. Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year,' he said, according to a video of his response posted here . 'I don't know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months,' he continued. 'Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people . We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity. Of all kinds.' The gathered shareholders responded with uproarious applause. Schultz concluded: 'If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much.' While national attitudes toward same-sex marriage have turned around over the past decade according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post survey , people who still support the traditional definition of marriage (even if they support a same-sex legal 'union') are openly mocked, ridiculed and labeled as 'bigots' and 'homophobes.' Not a free country for all While many Americans mouth platitudes about supporting First Amendment 'religious freedom,' anyone who voices an opinion that doesn't comport with the liberal point of view on this issue is chastised. If traditional marriage supporters are business owners, they are targeted for boycotts, picketed, and even sued in court. The end result is that the business is put out of business, and peoples' livelihoods are taken away from them. If the traditional marriage supporter is a politician or public figure, he or she will be shamed by the mainstream media, shouted down by gay rights activists (who are given platform after platform to do so by the mainstream media) and forced to apologize. The lone exception in the current 2016 presidential race is billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump, although he has not made any claims to only support traditional marriage. It's the worst kind of thought control, and it's about as anti-Constitution as it gets. After all, the nation's founding document is supposed to protect the rights of everyone to say and think what they wish as long as such speech is not otherwise deemed illegal (for example, slander). Even if we don't agree with what that person is saying. Apparently the Starbucks CEO stands with those who would usurp such speech because it's not what they personally believe. During his rant against the concerns of the traditional marriage shareholder, Schultz said, 'It's a free country.' However, his intolerance belies that; in a truly free country where all points of view are equally respected, he would not have felt the need to belittle anyone.

      " Tweet (NewsTarget) A recent multimillion-dollar ad campaign that lends support to Republican lawmakers who support the new Medicare prescription drug benefit was partly paid for by the pharmaceutical industry, political officials say. Though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it paid for the ads -- which are airing in 10 states -- a spokesman has refused to disclose whether or not the Chamber received funds from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), an organization representing the pharmaceutical industry. The commercials, designed in support of local congressmen and senators, say the Medicare drug program has saved hundreds of thousands of Medicare recipient's money since its inception. Democrats have used the disclosure to charge that the Medicare prescription drug benefit amounts to a plan engineered by Republicans to make more money for drug firms. 'There's a civics lesson here from the drug companies,' says Bill Burton, spokesman for the House Democratic campaign organization. 'They write checks to protect their GOP friends, and then they write the laws to benefit themselves -- all the while doctors are writing prescriptions middle-class Americans can't afford.' Ken Johnson, senior vice president of PhRMA, issued a statement that failed to elaborate on the issue: '[PhRMA] works with a variety of groups, including patient advocacy groups and business organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others, to support policies that improve access to life-saving medicines.' 'The depth of collusion among lawmakers, drug companies and government organizations is nothing less than astonishing,' said Mike Adams, a critic of the pharmaceutical industry and author of Take Back Your Health Power. 'That they would all conspire to create false advertising that misleads the American people into thinking they're getting a good deal on overpriced drugs is not at all surprising,' he added. 'Today's pharmaceutical industry is based almost entirely on propaganda, fraudulent science, corruption of government officials, disease mongering and the art of distorting public perception in order to maximize corporate profits.' ### \n",
      " It doesn't matter whether you are an opponent of Obamacare, as most Americans are, according to numerous surveys since the law's passage by Congress and subsequent rewrite and legitimization by the U.S. Supreme Court. You're going to pay for it anyway, and dearly, according to a new bombshell report from the Congressional Budget Office. As reported by Britain's Daily Mail newspaper in online editions, the cost to the federal government, or, more accurately, the taxpayers who fund it, for every new person insured under the law will be in the neighborhood of $50,000. The paper said budget figures like that one were buried within a 15-page section in the nonpartisan CBO's latest 10-year budget outlook. The Mail further reported: The best-case scenario described by the CBO would result in 'between 24 million and 27 million' fewer Americans being uninsured in 2025, compared to the year before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Pulling that off will cost Uncle Sam about $1.35 trillion -- or $50,000 per head. So much for Obama's ' cost estimates' Needless to say, the new CBO cost figures are nothing like those promised by President Obama and Democrats when they were pushing the measure as a bill in 2009 and 2010. The figures are astounding: It will take $1.993 trillion to hand out insurance subsidies to poor and middle class Americans, as well as to finance a huge expansion of Medicaid and CHIP, or Children's Health Insurance Program, costs. It is, without question, the largest wealth redistribution effort in a generation. To 'offset' those costs, the government will take in only $643 billion in new taxes, fees and penalties related to the Affordable Care Act. Part of that revenue will include the first-ever set of escalating financial penalties -- or, as the Supreme Court defined them, taxes -- on Americans who don't buy a product, in this case health insurance . The revenue also includes a new tax on medical devices, which is actually opposed by both Republicans and some Democrats in Congress (meaning, if this provision is finally repealed, then costs per newly insured person will be even higher). In an address to a joint session of Congress in 2009, Obama promised that his signature legislation would not cost this much. In fact, he said, 'the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years' (which is still more than the government is raising to 'pay' for it, but that's a separate issue). 'It would be a significant discount if the White House could return to that number today,' the Mail reported. In the same 2009 speech, Obama made the claim that there were 'more than 30 million American citizens who cannot get [health insurance] coverage.' Using Obama's cost figure of $900 billion, and 30 million who needed coverage, the price tag would still have been hefty -- $30,000 per head -- but not as hefty. That would be only about two-thirds of what the CBO now says the program will cost per insured. The nonpartisan congressional agency, along with the Joint Committee on Taxation -- a group of lawmakers from both chambers of Congress -- prepared the report, which was released Jan. 26, showing the overall direction of the federal budget. The report estimates that 'the net costs of the coverage provisions of the ACA will rise sharply as the effects of the act phase in from 2015 through 2017,' a period when Obama will be preparing to leave office. Millions will still be uninsured Further, costs will 'rise steadily through 2022' before leveling off for three years, economists for the two groups estimated. But, even then, the Obamacare program is expected to add an additional $145 billion in costs each year to a federal budget that is constantly in the red, adding to a federal debt that now has surpassed $18 trillion, or more than a year's worth of U.S. GDP. As the Mail further noted: That number doesn't include the insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs paid by Americans -- only the government's role in implementing the law and paying for its guarantees. The final insult is that, according to the CBO, there will still be 'between 29 million and 31 million' non-elderly Americans without medical insurance -- meaning this entire mammoth law was literally passed for nothing (except, perhaps, to give more centralized control over Americans' lives to Washington).

      " Increasingly, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is being put to the test by Western scientists -- and the results are sometimes not only successful but downright astounding. A case in point: a new review of CHM research by British scientists just published in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews shows treating endometriosis with Chinese herbs may not only relieve symptoms of the disease, CHM appears to have comparable benefits to drugs and even laparoscopic surgery with fewer adverse effects. This is important news because endometriosis is a huge problem in the US and Western medicine has yet to come up with any viable treatment that doesn't have serious side effects. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), at least 5.5 million women in North America alone have the disorder and 30 to 40 percent of them are infertile. A condition that causes tissue that normally lines the uterus to grow on the ovaries, bowels, and bladder, behind the uterus or elsewhere, endometriosis often produces debilitating pain that can keep a woman from going to work or school and put enormous strains on relationships. Endometriosis commonly causes severe cramps during menstrual periods, excessive bleeding during periods, chronic pelvic discomfort that can spread to the lower back and pain during or after sex. The cause of endometriosis remains unknown so doctors tend to treat it with prescription pain medications, hormones that can have devastating masculizing effects and even surgery to remove the endometrial growths. In some cases, doctors remove a woman's reproductive organs to try to reduce pain. As the Cochrane review points out, however, surgery doesn't always lead to long-term improvement in symptoms and drug treatments can cause a host of new problems such as hot flushes, acne and weight gain. The new study is the first English language systematic review of CHM for the treatment of endometriosis . The researchers analyzed, in particular, two trials of 158 women. In one clinical trial, therapy with Chinese herbs provided a reduction of symptoms that was comparable to the relief provided by the hormone medication gestrinone . However, the herbs, unlike the drug, caused few side effects. In the second trial, CHM was even more successful in treating endometriosis than the hormonal drug danazol . Once again, the Chinese herbs produced far fewer side effects than the Western medication. 'These findings suggest that Chinese herbs may be just as effective as certain conventional drug treatments for women suffering from endometriosis, but at present we don't have enough evidence to generalize the results,' said lead researcher Andrew Flower of the Complementary Medicine Research Unit at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom in a statement to the media. A growing number of scientists are actively studying the efficacy of CHM for other conditions, as well. For example, as reported previously in selfnews, researchers have found Chinese herbs can relieve menstrual cramps better than drugs ( http://www.selfnews.com/022969_menstrual_... ) and CHM may also be a successful treatment for type 2 diabetes ( http://www.selfnews.com/024051_diabetes_b... ). Earlier this year, scientists reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that Chinese herbs appear to help asthma patients, too.

      " Tweet Low-level exposure to a banned but lingering pesticide appears to accelerate changes in the brain that can potentially lead to the onset of Parkinson's disease symptoms years or even decades before they might naturally develop. This finding, by researchers at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, was presented today at the 232nd national meeting of the American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific society. The concept of an accelerated disease process is a new twist in the investigation of the long-suspected link between the use of pesticides and Parkinson's disease, according to the researchers. 'Our current study clearly shows that pesticides such as dieldrin appear to accelerate or exacerbate the already underlying disease,' said Gary Miller, Ph.D., an associate professor of environmental and occupational health at Emory University. 'Pesticides aren't necessarily the causative agents, but they do promote Parkinson's. So it appears the more you are exposed to pesticides, the greater your risk of developing the disease earlier in life.' In their pilot study, Miller and his co-researchers -- Emory graduate student Jaime Hatcher and Georgia Tech Professor Kurt Pennell, Ph.D. -- found that levels of dieldrin, an organochlorine pesticide developed in the 1940s as an alternative to DDT, were three times higher in the brains of 14 people who had Parkinson's disease than in the brains of 12 people who didn't. Based on this finding, the researchers estimated the lifetime exposure levels of these people and extrapolated these levels to mice. They then exposed laboratory mice to low, but 'environmentally relevant' dosages of dieldrin - about 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram. After one month, although none of the mice showed symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the researchers did detect increased levels of oxidative stress in the brain and significantly reduced uptake of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the development of Parkinson's. This latest work adds more evidence establishing a link between pesticides and Parkinson's. Earlier this year, a Harvard School of Public Health study of more than 140,000 adults found that those exposed to long-term, low levels of pesticides had a 70 percent higher incidence of Parkinson's disease. Another recent study, by the same Emory/Georgia Tech team, found that fetal rodents exposed to dieldrin had brain alterations that made them more susceptible to Parkinson's-inducing toxins. 'All of the evidence that has been accumulating suggests that exposure to pesticides increases the risk of Parkinson's disease,' Miller said. 'We believe that a person who is destined to get Parkinson's because of genetics or other factors at age 80 might develop symptoms when they're 65 or 70 if they have been exposed to pesticides.' Dieldrin, which was most commonly used to control agricultural pests and termites, was banned for most uses by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1974 after it was found to be harmful to fish and other wildlife. It was totally banned in 1987. Although no longer used, dieldrin can persist in the environment for decades and move up through the food chain, particularly in dairy products and meats, to humans, Pennell said. Over the next few decades, however, dieldrin and other banned pesticides should dissipate in the environment and become less of a factor in the development of Parkinson's disease, according to Miller. 'Today, people are being exposed to much lower levels of pesticides than people were 30 or 40 years ago,' Miller said. 'I would predict that over the course of the next several decades that we will see a decrease in the incidence of Parkinson's disease.' At least 500,000 Americans have Parkinson's disease and about 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The disease occurs when certain nerve cells die or become impaired and can no longer produce dopamine.

      " The Pentagon has recently announced that it will be moving sensitive and important communications equipment to nuclear-hardened Cold War facilities to protect against electromagnetic pulse events that could occur naturally, from sun bursts, or from overhead detonations of a nuclear weapon. As reported by Agence France-Presse (AFP), the gear is being moved back to Cheyenne Mountain, a hardened base operated by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). The facility scans for missile launches and aircraft entering U.S. airspace. The shift back to Cheyenne Mountain -- located in Colorado -- is not something that the Pentagon has undertaken on a whim; according to AFP, the Defense Department has inked a $700 million contract with Raytheon Corporation to get the job done. Such decisions usually follow analyses based on intelligence estimates. In other words, if the Pentagon didn't feel it was necessary to move the sensitive comms back to Cheyenne Mountain, especially in an era of military budget cuts, the move wouldn't be made. 'I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there' The head of NORAD and Northern Command, Navy Adm. William Gortney, said that, 'because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain's built, it's EMP-hardened.' 'And so, there's a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there,' Gortney said in a question-and-answer session with reporters. 'My primary concern was... are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there, and I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there,' he said. Cheyenne Mountain's bunker was carved into a mountain in the 1960s; it is a half-acre complex that is designed to withstand a nuclear attack. Inside the massive complex, Air Force personnel monitor airspace and are poised to send warnings that could potentially trigger a U.S. nuclear response. However, in 2006, the Defense Department moved NORAD and USNORTHCOM to Petersen Air Force Base in Colorado Springs; at the time, the Cheyenne facility was re-designated as an alternative communications site if needed. Somebody has obviously decided that, once again, it is needed. At the time that the center was moved to Petersen, officials said it was necessary as a means of boosting efficiency, even though hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of improvements and modernization at Cheyenne took place following the 9/11 attacks. Now, the Pentagon is moving back. 'A lot of the back office communications is being moved there,' one defense official told AFP. Concern about an EMP incident, either from a massive solar flare or due to an attack with nuclear weapons, has been an increasing concern among U.S. officials and lawmakers the past couple of years. In June 2013, we reported that a group of Republican lawmakers were pushing a plan to protect the nation's electrical infrastructure from an EMP attack or massive solar flare. EMP likelihood rising? A year later, Peter Vincent Pry , the executive director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security and director of the U.S. Nuclear Strategy Forum -- both of which are congressional advisory boards -- said improving our technology to avoid an EMP disaster was both financially feasible and extremely necessary in order to protect Americans. 'The problem is not the technology,' Pry said. 'We know how to protect against it. It's not the money, it doesn't cost that much. The problem is the politics. It always seems to be the politics that gets in the way.' 'If you do a smart plan -- the Congressional EMP Commission estimated that you could protect the whole country for about $2 billion,' Pry told Watchdog.org. 'That's what we give away in foreign aid to Pakistan every year.' He estimated that, within the first few minutes of an EMP incident, as many as 500,000 Americans could die. AFP further reported that Raytheon's work includes improvements to facilities at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

      " Large daily doses of B vitamins may protect vulnerable populations from the brain shrinkage and memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease, according to a study conducted by researchers from Oxford University and published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May. The new findings came from a reanalysis of data originally collected in 2010 from 271 older adults suffering from mild cognitive impairment, a form of memory loss considered a potential precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Although the brain naturally shrinks as we get older (about 0.5 percent per year), in people with mild cognitive impairment this shrinkage takes place twice as fast as usual. In Alzheimer's patients, shrinkage takes place four times as fast as usual. The researchers assigned participants to take either a placebo pill or a high daily dose of three B vitamins - folic acid (0.8 mg), vitamin B6 (20 mg) and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) - over the course of two years. They found that memory loss halted in those who took the B vitamins, but not in those who took the placebo. The vitamins also slowed brain shrinkage by 50 percent compared to the placebo, but only in patients with higher-than-normal blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine. The homocysteine connection In healthy humans, homocysteine levels are low because the amino acid is quickly transformed into other substances, including the memory-regulating chemical acetylcholine. Researchers have long known that in Alzheimer's patients, homocysteine levels tend to be high and acetylcholine levels tend to be low. Because B vitamins appear to play a role in converting homocysteine into acetylcholine, researchers had wondered if the vitamins might help stem the development of Alzheimer's. Researchers remain unsure whether it is high levels of homocysteine, low levels of acetylcholine, or some other factor that leads to the development of Alzheimer's. Whatever the case, however, the 2010 study was the first to directly showed that increasing B vitamin levels might have a clinical effect. 'B vitamins lower homocysteine, which directly leads to a decrease in GM atrophy, thereby slowing cognitive decline,' the researchers wrote. New analysis strengthens findings One of the weaknesses of the original analysis, however, was that researchers could not prove that the observed improvements in memory were related to the decreased rate of brain shrinkage. In the new study, researchers conducted a more advanced analysis of the original data and found that the effect of the B vitamins was actually much greater than they had in initially thought: Among those taking the vitamins, brain shrinkage was reduced by an astonishing 90 percent, not just 50 percent. 'I've never seen results from brain scans showing this level of protection,' said brain imaging expert Paul Thompson, who heads the world's largest brain scan database at the UCLA School of Medicine 's Imaging Genetics Center. 'We study the brain effects of all sorts of lifestyle changes - alcohol reduction, exercising more, learning to handle stress, weight loss - and a good result would be a 25 percent reduction in shrinkage.' Notably, the new analysis also found that the B vitamins had the greatest protective benefit in the very areas of the brain that are most affected by Alzheimer's, including regions responsible for learning, memory and the organization of thoughts. The analysis also showed that the reduction in this damage was indeed directly responsible for halting participants' memory loss. 'The study needs to be repeated because there's a lot to learn about why homocysteine is damaging and whether lowering it can stop people with memory problems progressing to Alzheimer's,' said Thompson, who was not involved in the study. 'But if the results survive retesting, homocysteine level could be a useful biomarker for Alzheimer's risk.' \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) Diets that have plenty of olive oil may be helping prevent body cell damage that can lead to cancer, suggests a study by researchers in Denmark. Researchers from Copenhagen University Hospital looked at 182 men between the ages of 20 and 60, hailing from five European countries, for two weeks. During that time, the men consumed one-quarter cup of olive oil a day, and showed an average 13 percent reduction in 8oxodG, a marker of oxidative damage to DNA cells. This damage is usually caused when reactive oxygen species -- metabolism byproducts -- overcome the body's antioxidant defenses. While olive oil is known to contain phenols, which are believed to be powerful antioxidants, they do not account for the drop in oxidative damage to DNA, said study co-author Dr. Henrick E. Poulsen and colleagues. The men consumed olive oils with varying levels of phenols, but the oxidative damage was reduced regardless of these levels. The study results -- reported in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology's The FASEB Journal -- seem to suggest that the monosaturated fats found in olive oil are more likely causing the beneficial effect, the scientists said. The study participants from Northern Europe showed higher 8oxodG levels than their Southern European counterparts, which could account for the fact that, in the past, men from Northern Europe have been found to have higher rates of cancer than men in Southern Europe, where the olive-oil-rich 'Mediterranean diet' is a staple. In fact, the scientists reported, Northern Europeans generally have higher levels certain cancers, including breast, colon, ovarian and prostate cancers. Poulsen said the evidence supports advice that suggests replacing saturated fats from meats and butter with vegetable fats such as olive oil. However, he was quick to point out that olive oil was just one part of the Mediterranean diet, which is also rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish. He added that olive oil's benefits notwithstanding, it was not a replacement for calorie control and regular exercise. ### \n",
      " As more and more countries within the European Union struggle economically, the euro - the union's common currency - becomes more embattled, with its founder now even predicting its demise. German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, who was responsible the euro's development and launch, is now calling for the end of the single currency in order to let southern Europe recover. He says if not, the current fiscal course is 'leading to disaster.' 'The economic situation is worsening from month to month, and unemployment has reached a level that puts democratic structures ever more in doubt,' he said, according to the Telegraph , one of Britain's largest dailies. 'The Germans have not yet realized that southern Europe, including France, will be forced by their current misery to fight back against German hegemony sooner or later,' he said, adding that much of the current fiscal crisis has come in large part from Germany's squeeze on wages, in order to gain export share. 'Austerity is finished' On the parliamentary website of Germany's Left Party, Lafontaine said German Chancellor Angela Merkel will 'awake from her self-righteous slumber' once the European countries in economic dire straits come together to force changes in crisis policy, at the expense of Germany. Lafontaine's dire prediction appeared to gain credibility as French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici 'proclaimed the end of austerity and a triumph of French policy, risking further damage to the tattered relations between Paris and Berlin,' the paper reported. 'Austerity is finished. This is a decisive turn in the history of the EU project since the euro,' Moscovici told French TV. 'We're seeing the end of austerity dogma. It's a victory of the French point of view.' The French minister's comments came on the heels of a deal with Brussels giving France and Spain an additional two years to meet deficit targets of 3 percent of GDP. But his triumphant tone could mean that hardliners in Berlin will become angry, confirming fears that such concessions will only lead to more fiscal chaos in the months ahead. In early May German Vice-Chancellor Philipp Rosler attacked the European Commission, calling its decision to undermine the necessary belt-tightening 'irresponsible.' Whether the current breakdown of the German-Franco alliance that has driven politics on the continent for more than a half-century is the fault of Berlin or Paris may be irrelevant at this point, but clearly the situation is spiraling out of control. France's Socialist Party - which now controls the prime minister's office - lashed out at the 'selfish intransigence' of Merkel, accusing her of thinking over of 'German savers, her trade balance, and her electoral future.' For his part, Lafontaine said he backs EMU but just doesn't think it is sustainable. 'Hopes that the creation of the euro would force rational economic behavior on all sides were in vain,' he said, noting that the policy of forcing Spain, Portugal, and Greece to carry out internal devaluations was a 'catastrophe.' The economies of those three nations, plus Ireland and Holland, are among the EU's worst. The euro has been in decline for months now, and as nations of the EU continue to deal with high unemployment and high government spending due to overpromising of benefits and lower revenues, there doesn't seem to be a future for the currency , much less the EU as a viable entity, experts believe. In March, the Atlantic Monthly also reported that it is just a matter of time before the demise of the euro, simply because the EU doesn't have the fiscal infrastructure - or never had it - to make a common currency work: Here's the Cliff Notes version of the euro crisis. The euro zone doesn't have the fiscal or banking unions it needs to make monetary union work, and it's not close to changing that. In the meantime, the euro's continuing flaws continue to suck countries into crisis. And their politics get radicalized. Most recently, Cyprus was forced to accept a bailout and bail-in, because its too-big-to-save banks made some horrendously bad bets on Greek bonds. Fundamental flaws in the euro's design Here are some of the euro's basic flaws: Money is too tight. The euro zone is not what economists would label an optimal place for currency. 'In other words,' Atlantic Monthly says, 'it was a bad idea.' Part of the reason why is because the various EU members should have different monetary policies but they don't. Budgets are too tight. Experts believe austerity has been an utter failure, if not outright disaster, because it has actually increased debt burdens across southern Europe especially. 'The euro has become an austerity suicide pact.' Not enough trade. Save Germany, a little more than half of the EU's nations primarily trade with each other. As southern Europe slides into depression and northern Europe edges toward recession, each will purchase even less from the others. As with all socialist countries, the nations of Europe simply do not have enough resources to continue providing cradle-to-grave services for their people. That is angering to tens of millions who have been raised to believe that the European money pit is bottomless but who are now realizing the fallacy of such thinking. As an aside, it is important to note that both world wars last century began on a tumultuous European continent . \n",
      " Do American liberals and conservatives look at political, social and ethical issues as if they are from different cultures? Yes, according to a new landmark study that examined the differences. The cultural psychology study, conducted by the University of Virginia, found that, essentially, political conservatives in the U.S. are somewhat like East Asians in the manner in which they categorize, think and perceive. Meanwhile, 'liberals in the U.S. could be categorized as extreme Americans in thought, categorization and perception,' said a press release describing the study's findings, which have been published recently in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin . In addition, researchers found evidence that styles of thought -- whether holistic or analytical -- can be altered through training, and enough so that temporary changes in political thought and the way a person votes could occur. 'We found in our study that liberals and conservatives think as if they were from completely different cultures -- almost as different as East and West,' said study leader Thomas Talhelm, a Ph.D. candidate in cultural psychology. Conservative thinking dominates the world 'Liberals and conservatives categorize and perceive things differently, just as East Asians and Westerners look differently at the world,' he continued. Talhelm said that, according to study findings, American conservatives, generally speaking, and East Asians in particular, are intuitive, or 'holistic,' thinkers, though Westerners, generally, and American liberals in particular, think in a more analytical manner. That said, the term culture war is thought to be an accurate, though dramatic, description of the clear cultural differences in thought processes between conservatives and liberals 'On psychological tests, Westerners tend to view scenes, explain behavior and categorize objects analytically,' Talhelm said, according to the press release. 'But the vast majority of people around the world -- about 85 percent -- more often think intuitively -- what psychologists call holistic thought, and we found that's how conservative Americans tend to think.' The Ph.D candidate said holistic thought uses intention and the perception of whole objects or situations most often, instead of dissecting them into their individual parts -- like having a general feeling about a given situation involving intuition or tact. Meanwhile, he added, the study results indicated that analytical thinkers tend to examine parts of a situation and how they may work in tandem, toward the whole. This process involves 'slicing up the world and analyzing objects individually, divorced from context,' Talhelm said. The press release further stated: Studies show that analytical thinkers predominate in Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic societies (termed 'WEIRD' societies in 2010 by a team of cultural psychologists at the University of British Columbia). But they make up only about 15 percent of the world's population. So, in other words, in a WEIRD society like that found in the United States, analytical-thinking liberals are considered 'extreme Americans,' said Talhelm, in the manner that they are disinclined to think like the vast majority of the rest of the world, and that includes holistically thinking conservatives in their own country. Liberal thinking must be learned But, the researcher noted, there is some value in both ways of thinking. Intuitive thinking, Talhelm said, is likely the 'default' style that most people are born with. Analytical thinking, he continued, must necessarily be learned through training -- as in Western-style school systems (Writer's note: The term indoctrination comes immediately to mind). In testing thought styles, psychologists give study participants a short series of tests to determine what manner of thinker they happen to be -- holistic or analytic. 'One such test asks participants to choose two of three items to categorize together, such as a mitten, a scarf, and a hand,' said the press release. 'Analytic thinkers usually match the scarf and mitten because they belong to the same abstract category -- items of winter clothing. Holistic thinkers usually match the mitten and hand because the hand wears a mitten.' Researchers found, however, that political thought could be manipulated. Holistic thinkers could be trained to think analytically, for instance, to match scarf with mitten; in doing so, they would begin to view the world more liberally (except on economic policy). Likewise, in reverse, for liberal thinkers. Sources: http://psp.sagepub.com http://www.designntrend.com https://news.virginia.edu \n",
      " If the Food and Drug Administration and Congress get their way, it will become much easier for the mainstream psychiatry community to utilize unregulated, dangerous electroshock therapy, even though it has been proven to be ineffective and mentally damaging in the past. An alert sent out by the Citizens Commission on Human Rights International, a mental health watchdog group, says that the FDA is seeking to lower the classification of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) devices from the highest Class III rating to Class II, the same category as air purifiers and contact lenses. 'Any medical experts, healthcare professionals, lawyers, ECT survivors and their families/friends that could provide knowledge of the damage ECT causes should comment and oppose the ECT device being rated as Class II for the treatment of any mental disorder,' says the alert. According to the proposed rule change [ here ], the devices are being reclassified 'for use in treating severe major depressive episode (MDE) associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BPD) in patients 18 years of age and older who are treatment-resistant or who require a rapid response due to the severity of their psychiatric or medical condition ... based on new information.' 'The FDA is doing this despite 3,045 people responding to an earlier public docket on ECT in 2009, of which 79% opposed reclassification and only 14% supported it and where 1,857 or 61% of the respondents reported a negative effective from ECT ,' CCHRI stated. What's more, the group said, the FDA is well aware of the health risks in using ECT devices. Meaningless 'special controls' 'The FDA admits in the Proposal that there are risks of irregular heartbeat or ischemia/infarction (i.e., heart attack); high or low blood pressure; cognitive and memory impairment, 'ECT treatment may result in the development of hypomanic or manic symptoms,' prolonged seizures, moderate pain following the induced seizure and Death may result from various complications of ECT such as reactions to anesthesia, cardiovascular complications, pulmonary complications, or stroke,' said the organization. CCHRI said the FDA denies that the devices can cause brain damage, even though patients who had received ECT treatment have testified otherwise. What's more, the FDA's claims that it will impose 'special controls' on the devices is largely meaningless, the group said, noting they were largely 'labeling provisions' to include: -- Disclosure of contraindications, precautions, warnings, and potential adverse effects/complications...and patients can be advised of conditions under which ECT treatment should not proceed; -- Specific device use instructions including information regarding conduct of pre-ECT patient assessments; and information on appropriate patient monitoring during an ECT procedure) to minimize potential ECT procedural complications. The mental health watchdog said the FDA's reclassification of the devices would not include treatment for other mental disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar manic states, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and catatonia. The agency proposes to leave the devices at the Class III level, meaning they would require a Premarket Approval (PMA) within 90 days. However, the watchdog said, the FDA has known since 1979 that 'device manufacturers have refused to [submit PMAs] and the companies and psychiatrists from the American Psychiatric Association claim its 'too expensive' for the manufacturers to conduct clinical trials.' No oversight 'Additionally, the FDA states that it did not find sufficient evidence to show that even with 'special controls' implemented, the device would be safe and effective for these other disorders (but apparently it's OK to administer hundreds of volts of electricity if you are older than 18 with either or both of the specified disorders),' CCHRI said. In addition to the proposed rule change, Medicine.news reported in January that legislation has been introduced in Congress to relax medical device standards. That bill, the 21st Century Cures Act , introduced by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., would essentially allow medical devices to be used on patients without their prior consent. The measure completely 'relaxes scientific standards, virtually guaranteeing insufficiently tested drugs will hit the market only to be recalled after the damage is done,' says Lee Spiller, CCHRI's executive director.

      " Magnesium is an essential micronutrient found in a wide variety of foods yet the US Department of Agriculture estimates that only about half of the population gets enough of it in their diets. How essential is it? Magnesium is found in every single cell in the body, with the highest concentrations in the bones and teeth, followed by the brain, heart and blood. It is involved in 300 separate metabolic functions. Because relatively little of the body's magnesium circulates in the blood, however, it can be hard to test magnesium levels directly. Instead, people and their doctors need to be on the alert for the early warning signs of deficiency. Symptoms to watch for What exactly does magnesium do in the body? In a nutshell: a little of everything. It is required for the production of energy by the body, along with DNA, RNA, protein and fat. It helps maintain blood vessels dilated at appropriate levels for heart health, and helps maintain oral and immune health. Magnesium also plays a key role in maintaining the electrolyte balance of cells, which means it critically affects nerve signals, muscle contractions and heartbeat. In its early phases, magnesium deficiency leads to digestive symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. It also causes weakness and fatigue. Early magnesium deficiency has also been linked with sleep disturbances, including insomnia, and mood disturbances such as anxiety and depression. If the problem is not addressed in its early phases, deficiency will likely worsen. Ongoing, low-grade deficiency may lead to chronic health problems including osteoporosis, heart disease and diabetes. Low levels of magnesium in the brain have been linked to the tremors associated with Parkinson's disease. More severe deficiency produces numbness and tingling, along with muscle dysfunction including twitches, cramps, seizures, abnormal heart rhythm and spasms, and even difficulty breathing. It can also produce personality changes. The groups at highest risk of magnesium deficiency are the elderly, diabetics, people who take diuretics and women who use hormonal birth control. Preventing or correcting deficiency How can you protect yourself from magnesium deficiency, or start correcting it if you worry your levels may be too low? If your deficiency is not severe, the best place to start is always by improving your diet. Magnesium is found in a wide variety of foods including beans, whole grains, leafy green vegetables, avocados, and seeds and nuts. Unfortunately, these foods are typically not consumed enough in the Western diet. Magnesium is also found in dark chocolate. For context, just 1 ounce of dry, roasted almonds or cashews or a half cup of spinach contains 20 percent of your daily magnesium requirement. You can get 15 percent of your daily magnesium from 1 cup of soy milk or a half cup of black beans. One cup of avocado, a 3.5 ounce baked potato (with skin), a half cup of brown rice, 1 cup of low-fat yogurt, and a single serving of fortified breakfast cereal all provide 10 percent of your daily magnesium needs. Magnesium is best absorbed by the body when it is consumed along with calcium and vitamin B6. You should aim to consume between 500 and 1,000 mg of magnesium daily. If you do choose to take a magnesium supplement, look for one that also includes these nutrients . You can also boost your body's effective use of magnesium by taking a supplement that also includes the magnesium co-factors glycinate, malate, orotate and taurinate. These increase your body's absorption of magnesium, while optimizing magnesium's effects on your heart, muscles, mood and general bodily systems. Magnesium glycinate is the form most effective at helping to correct long-term deficiency. \n",
      " Officials with Riverside County, Calif., removed a newborn baby from her mother without a valid reason or a court-ordered warrant, a practice that the county does very often, according to claims made by the mother in a federal class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff in the suit, known as 'A.A.,' which is the baby, filed suit against the county, Juvenile Dependency Investigator Karla Torres, Torres' supervisor Felicia M. Butler, and 'all similarly situated county social workers and investigators' Dec. 12, Courthouse News Service reported. The plaintiff's attorney, Shawn McMillan, told the news service that his firm, which focuses on civil rights cases against government child protective agencies, 'uncovered an alarming trend' about one year ago while undergoing discovery for other cases. 'County child welfare agencies regularly subvert the constitutional rights of parents and children by seizing children from their parents when there is no danger to the child, and in fact no need to seize the child at all,' McMillan told Courthouse News Service . 'The class action is designed to address a procedural problem. They [Riverside County social workers] as a matter of course don't get warrants before seizing kids,' he continued. 'Deficient policies, deficient training and deficient supervision all lead to civil rights violations on a regular basis. This lawsuit is designed to address the problem.' Child was healthy and in no danger The 27-page suit claims that A.A. is just one of thousands of children who were wrongfully taken away from their parents by the county's social workers. 'In February 2013, when she was three days old, plaintiff A.A. was snatched by an employee of the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services literally from the breast of her mother as they lay in the hospital recuperating from a successful, safe delivery,' the complaint said. The child 'was healthy and in no danger whatever; her mother has no history of drug, alcohol, or tobacco use nor any history of psychiatric treatment,' the suit says. Further, the county 'had unlawfully seized (A.A.'s) four siblings months before and sent them into foster care,' the suit continues. It also claims that 'thousands of other children' have been taken by Riverside County's child agencies 'without any sort of warrant and without any risk of serious injury.' The suit notes that Tonita Rogers gave birth to A.A. via Caesarean section and then spent a few days recovering and bonding with her newborn. Rogers, in the suit, claims she was in good health and 'fully capable of taking care' of the child. In fact, three days later, Torres came to her hospital room and was able to see that she was recovering very well and that her newborn was healthy, the complaint states. 'Despite these facts, and solely because there had been an earlier dependency petition filed regarding plaintiffs' siblings, Torres seized the newborn baby plaintiff from her mother's care and custody,' says the complaint. They ought to know better Rogers says that Torres 'did not bother to seek a warrant,' which the complaint states would have likely taken about two hours. Torres also did not seek an ex parte petition for non-custodial removal before taking A.A., it says. McMillan told the news service that A.A. was returned to Rogers five to ten days later. He added that a number of seized children are taken out of their mothers' care for a year or more. He noted that half of his firm's cases involve African American children like A.A., and 'a large portion' are from poorer families. But he noted that white and upper-class parents were still not 'immune' from the problem, and that some of his firm's cases involved 'medical doctors and investment bankers.' Plaintiffs maintain that county social workers ought to know better than taking children without a warrant, as such behavior is illegal and in violation of basic civil rights protections. Further, the complaint says the county 'turned a blind eye' to what its social workers were doing.

      " Women who would like to significantly reduce the risk of ovarian cancer now have a natural and simple way to do so. Researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have conducted studies indicating that daily consumption of tea and citrus fruits can lower the risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer by nearly a third. The UK's Express reports on the findings: The research team studied the dietary habits of 171,940 women aged between 25 and 55 for more than three decades. The team found that those who consumed food and drinks high in flavonols - which are found in tea, red wine, apples and grapes - and flavanones - which are found in citrus fruit and juices - were less likely to develop the disease. [1] This is particularly good news, considering that ovarian cancer is the fifth biggest cancer threat to women -- at least in Britain -- and is sometimes referred to as the 'silent killer,' because its symptoms aren't noticeable until the disease has progressed significantly. More than half of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer die within five years. Flavones and flavonols are subclasses of dietary flavonoids, and since they are found so readily in any supermarket, they represent an inexpensive and easy way for women to protect themselves from this deadly form of cancer. Professor Aedin Cassidy, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: The main sources of these compounds include tea and citrus fruits and juices, which are readily incorporated into the diet, suggesting that simple changes in food intake could have an impact on reducing ovarian cancer risk. In particular, just a couple of cups of black tea every day was associated with a 31 per cent reduction in risk. Medical News Today also reported on the results of the new research: Results show that participants who had the highest intakes of flavonol and flavanone had a lower risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer than those who had the lowest intakes. [2] The results are not entirely conclusive, but the large sample size (171,940 women) and the long-term follow-up of the study make the findings very encouraging. Limitations of the study's findings include the fact that: ...the mean cumulative dietary flavonoid intakes were calculated from recent US Department of Agriculture (USDA) databases with input from other sources, but flavonoid contents can vary in foods, depending on growth and processing conditions. Additionally, while the team adjusted for possible confounders linked with ovarian cancer risk, they say there was still the possibility of 'residual confounding from unmeasured factors. ' However, after careful adjustment for these potential confounders, it is unlikely that they could have accounted for the results that the researchers observed. More conclusive studies need to be performed, but in the meanwhile women can begin to adjust their dietary routines to include daily consumption of the foods which contain these compounds. It certainly makes sense to do so, especially in light of the fact that most of these foods are already part of a healthy and nutritious diet. So, ladies, the next time you enjoy a nice cup of black tea or a glass of citrus juice, you can also feel good about the fact that you are very likely -- and significantly -- helping your body reduce the risk of developing one of the most dreaded forms of cancer.

      " Climate change, a phrase that typically instills fear in society, is being eyed by Arizona State University as something that could be beneficial. Contrary to those who view climate change as only having catastrophic consequences, experts from the university suggest that it is responsible for re-greening parts of the world and changing lives for the better. Experts from the university engaged in a study that ultimately showed that the West African Sahel, the strip south of the Sahara desert, has been 'regreening' ever since droughts in the 1970s and 80s killed more than 100,000 people. They maintain that increased rainfall caused by climate change has led to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which has spurred more plant growth and community-led farming efforts. The region is turning around and experiencing a vast change from the drought and deaths that once plagued it. The area is greening, plants are growing, and people are coming together. These changes bring improvements in the physical and emotional well-being of the region's inhabitants, which can ultimately bolster relationships and reverse poverty levels. Despite positive outcomes from climate change, fears persist The journal that published this information, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America ( PNAS ), states that '...long-term satellite-derived greenness sensitivity to rainfall' was analyzed to better understand '...changing vegetation structure in different regions of the Sahel.' According to the paper, 'Our results show that remotely sensed vegetation greenness...has increased across the Sahel since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s, consistent with increasing rainfall and earlier analyses.' The report was titled, 'On regreening and degradation in Sahelian watersheds.' Unfortunately, there are some people cling tightly to negative views about change of any kind, and climate change is no different. The alarmist web site DeSmog is one such outlet, and it is said to have jumped on Arizona State University's Sahel findings. They vehemently stated that, 'The greening is unreliable. It is thus hardly an encouraging example of a 'positive impact' from global warming.' Perhaps in anticipation of naysayer attitudes like that of DeSmog, the PNAS paper states: Meanwhile, in the popular press and often in the environmental and development literature, the reports of recovery are sometimes forgotten to the extent that popular opinion in the West - and indeed very often in Africa - holds fast to pessimistic images of overgrazing, degradation, sand storms, and sand-dunes 'marching' south from the Sahara towards the sea. The differences in perception of recent changes highlight the need to quantify the extent of recovery (or otherwise) in Sahelian systems since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s and the extent to which vegetation changes in the Sahel respond proportionally to climate variations. Embrace change rather than resist it Without a doubt, climate change is occurring. In fact, at a 2014 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) conference attended by about 1,000 climate experts in Canada, there was much talk of significant climate changes that could be experienced by 2050. Gigantic waves, increased in-flight air turbulence, flash flooding, dramatic temperature surges, and superstorms are expected to become more commonplace. We've seen it already; areas that haven't seen snow in many years - if ever - have suddenly been blanketed by it. Other regions are dealing with extreme cold or heat. The changes continue, and we must learn to change along with them. Rather than adopting a fearful attitude, it might be best for society to focus on moving forward. Perhaps making an effort to work smarter and in tandem with climate changes instead of resisting them would improve life on the planet. \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) This interview is an excerpt from Kevin Gianni's Renegade Water Secrets, which can be found at ( http://www.renegadewatersecrets.com ) . In this excerpt, Iain Trousdell talks about embracing a water philosophy. Renegade Water Secrets with Iain Trousdell, founder of New Zealand's Living Water Institute. Kevin: Someone who's hearing this call, they have an interest in water and the different aspects of water, what it can do, how does someone embrace this kind of philosophy and use it for... there's a higher consciousness, I guess. Iain: Well, I think the world definitely needs a higher consciousness. That's self evident. So how we find that is a marvelous dynamic drama and it's very important, central. But we've worked our group in our very simple companies and their research institutes have worked mostly privately and we got to a point and then our government did help us occasionally, private corporations would help us if there was someone in there who understood what we were talking about and appreciated what we were doing. So turning around in the last five or six years, Kevin, maybe a bit more, that suddenly thinking in the West is changing so rapidly in a positive manner, thank goodness, and folks are not just giving us sick grins when we start talking about what we're doing. Kevin: Right. Iain: That's how it used to be. 'Oh, go hug a tree.' You know, you're just talking about fairies but now they're going 'Oh, wow, really?' and 'Tell me more,' or 'how can I find out more?' So we're in the process of setting up internet websites and ways of becoming part of databases and being on the map soon. Kevin: Right. Iain: So one way that folks could associate themselves with us is to go to ( www.healingwaterinstitute.net ) and just a bit down the left, there's a sign up form there and you get free autoresponder emails on the creative secrets of water I send to you over a 10-12 week period, just explaining more on the sort of things that you and I have been discussing today. I've also recently bought waterfriends.net, which no one had. Kevin: Okay. Iain: So we were planning to develop that as a group of people who can find ways of helping around the world in different ways. Kevin: Now, what is your own practice with water? Are you experimenting with the Flow Forms for your own drinking consumption? Iain: Oh, yes, I do. I also use them for my garden and for treatment of catalytic materials to empower the garden. Kevin: Let's talk about that a little bit. Iain: Sorry, what's that? Kevin: Talk about that a little bit. Iain: That's the bionamics agriculture. Kevin: Okay. Iain: And Rudolf Steiner gave a number of very interesting recipes for developing extra life supporting capacity in the soil and one of them, in particular, is cow manure which gets placed into a cow horn which has a spiral and you leave it in the ground over winter and in the spring, it has a remarkable quality where if you mix it rhythmically with water and spray that water out over your property, the living organisms in the soil respond in a truly remarkable way which is now being scientifically proven and annotated over an 80-year period. For instance, in India, it was the scientists at the agricultural colleges who first got most excited about bionamics when it was introduced to them by Peter Proctor in New Zealand and who's now in his 80's. And it spread from their scientific research into the villages and cooperatives. So we use Flow Forms as part of that because of the increasing capacity to support life. Kevin: You use Flow Forms to mix? Iain: To stir the cow manure. We do drink... we run our tap water through Flow Forms to drink at home, but primarily what's happened to me is, I've been a teacher over many years, but at the same time did Flow Forms. I've worked with Flow Forms; I've been personally involved in 400-450 projects around the Pacific. I've lived in New Zealand most of that time. Major projects are city centers, kindergartens, hospitals, therapeuticoms, many home gardens, ponds -- it's remarkable what they do for a pond because many people dig ponds and of course in nature, a pond, unless it's a monsoon or been captured by flash flooding, has a stream. Kevin: Right. Iain: And the stream keeps the pond alive. The pond can't move properly or have moving water coming through it. Of course, it becomes stagnant and all sorts of creatures like mosquitoes and malaria and what have you, so also algae. So we've got remarkable stories of introducing Flow Form-treated water to ponds. Kevin: And how does that happen? Iain: Even with ponds that have had running water going into them, we just put a Flow Form into the running water and even then there's a remarkable change. Kevin: And how does... Iain: There's been scientific research from Holland, Sweden and many other places. Kevin: You put it into the water source? How does that happen? Iain: The Flow Form? Kevin: Yeah. Iain: For instance, take swimming pools. We've got five or six swimming pools in New Zealand which have no chlorine use at all. Basically, your swimming pool is a captured body of water that gets taken out through a filter and sort of pumped and whacked back into the pools. So it's not really helping the water a lot except chemically cleaning it and then, because of the pathogens that can develop in this water that doesn't support life, we throw in a ton of chlorine which kills off stuff and that also impacts the water quality. So the water's basically an unhappy chappy in there. So I've never had anyone, if I say to them, 'Would you like water to go through a mountain stream.' And everyone goes 'Well, yeah, of course, that would be great.' Okay, would you like the mountain stream to be artistic, sound beautiful, relaxing and, hey we'll throw a heart pulse in as well just as added measure. So people have these. They get five, seven Flow Forms set up by their swimming pool and suddenly the water's soft and silky and sparkly and feels fresh and there's just the need to put the same amount of chlorine in it. Of course, we tell people to test it and do everything and watch their health and all the legal issues. Kevin: Sure. Iain: Some folk have natural swimming pools so it looks like a mountain pond. They've got trees in it and filtration and it gets run through a biological filter, reeds and rushes and Flow Forms... So that's fun. We can do that. It's another one of our 40 niche markets. And so we're setting up also our business Nature Intelligence International. My company, Design for Life, with my teams in New Zealand, we're joining forces commercially with John Wilkes and his company in England created a company called Nature Intelligence and we're just starting that company now in America and have interest from 7 or 8 different countries to start business there and there have been inquiries from 53 countries now for Flow Forms over the last 30 years. Two and a half thousand, two thousand four hundred or so projects have been completed in that time. Kevin: Wow. Iain: We are ready now with means of mass production which we've developed ceramics in Vietnam with wonderful colleagues there and also a method of rotational composite stone crafting, so we're ready to mass produce and we just got ourselves to this point with regard to the business and also our Healing Water Institutes in New Zealand and Britain and we're setting one up in America. Kevin: Okay and where do you see this in the future, say 10, 15, 20 years. Iain: Well, I think we have a realistic approach. We estimate that... we are planning to sell hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Flow Forms in the next 15-20 years and we've got a number of folks, some of them high-level international water consultants, coming to us saying 'You're going to need hundreds of millions of dollars to gear up with the world need for Flow Forms once people realize what you're doing' and so we're happy with a few million to get that up and going. But that was his point. He's saying 'How about eco-villages?' You've got thirty thousand houses... They're being built all over the place now. When I'm going around, for instance, to places like this or spas or hotel chains, I've had someone else tell me about eco-villages, an engineer who's working in London. So say there's a town of thirty thousand houses all being built, everything's perfect, top level sustainability, and they go, 'Well, of course, we've got to have Flow Forms in there to enliven the water.' Kevin: Right, like if it's captured rain water? Iain: Captured rain water, tap water, once the science gets a bit clearer, we're just collaborating with a couple of our top Ph.D. guys who are working with us collecting more scientific research and more modern theoretical basis for the way we work. We're up to 80 pages. It's going to turn into 100 and we'll publish that. And this is scientific work that Ph.D. guys from top level universities are prepared to put their name on. Kevin: Right. Iain: So when these sort of things are published, we bring all the marketing and the knowledge and the propensity to produce, all of that together. So our hope is it's conceivable we get an engineering building group who says 'Okay, we need three Flow Forms for each of the thirty thousand houses, when can you deliver?' Kevin: Right. Iain: So we get an order for ninety thousand Flow Forms and I think that's only a year or two away. Kevin: That's great, that's great. Iain: We've been preparing for this for seven years now, Kevin. Our group down in New Zealand and John's excited about us and it's an exciting entrepreneurial venture combined with our research and design. Kevin: And how do you see it changing the people who are living in those environments? Iain: Sorry, I'm missing that. Kevin: How do you see it changing or affecting the people who are living in those environments? Iain: Well, it's very interesting. Again, this is anecdotal, but we get people telling us 'Hey, we can sleep better. We're not just so stressed. We're just relaxing...' We have already set them up in kindergartens, for instance, and the kids just love them. Because you're feeling life is in your rhythmic system, in your heart and in your chest, when we live in such an arrhythmic out of touch world, often, don't we, in cities and when people consciously or unconsciously are in an environment which has a rhythmic sound, soft and relaxing sort of environment, the air changes, the earth. Something pretty fundamental changes in them. I've had some extraordinary statements from folks and kindergartens -- we get children who are a bit overactive, they tend to calm down and focus on what's happening in their marvelous little stream. And the kids who are a bit shy, come along and start to talk and people cooperate. It's remarkable. It's just simply remarkable. Kevin: Well, I think that's probably a great way to end this interview here. Iain: Well, indeed, it's a huge topic and it's a very exciting one. Water is the big issue, as you know, with regards to your project putting all these things together. There are two billion people at the moment who have daily problems getting fresh water for drinking, washing and cooking.

      " Army Veteran Donald Siefkin wasn't asking for much when he called the emergency room at the Seattle VA Hospital on February 27. The 64-year-old was parked just a few feet from the ER entrance and was in severe pain from a broken foot he had suffered earlier that day. The pain was getting worse, and his foot swelled to the 'size of a football' on a 3.5-hour drive to the Seattle-Tacoma airport from his home in Kennewick, Washington. While preparing to take his wife to the airport to catch a red-eye flight, Siefkin had 'stepped down funny and heard a snap.' During the drive, the swelling and pain increased so he decided to head straight for the Seattle VA hospital to seek medical care before attempting to drive back home. By the time Siefkin reached the hospital parking lot at around 3:30 am, the pain had become excruciating, so he called the emergency room front desk to request assistance getting inside. He could no longer walk because of the swelling and the pain, and he needed someone to bring a wheelchair and push him inside the building. This sounds like a manageable request, right? The hospital employee who answered the phone refused Siefkin's request. After a brief argument, the employee told him, 'No, we're not going to come get you. You're going to have to call 911 and you'll have to pay for that.' The employee then hung up on him. A Seattle Times article about the incident says: By 3:47 a.m., a Seattle fire captain and three firefighters manning Engine Company 30 arrived to wheel Siefken into the ER. Staff members examined him, took X-rays, put a boot on his foot and prescribed Hydrocodone for his pain. Siefken, who declined to take the medication for fear he'd be unsafe to drive, drove back home to Kennewick after the hospital wouldn't put him up for the night. He arrived four hours later, took a painkiller and crawled into bed. When initial inquiries were made about the case, Chad Hutson, spokesman for the Veteran Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, said: 'I know it sounds counterintuitive because someone is just 10 feet away, but it is our policy to do that.' Later, however, the VA contradicted that statement and issued a written apology, which stated in part: When the Veteran told our emergency room staff that he did not have an urgent or emergent medical issue, our staff should have considered the request for help as a patient assistance issue. The emergency room personnel should have called the appropriate staff to come and assist the patient, ensuring he made it into the emergency room safely. Siefkin was satisfied with the apology, saying: They said they're sorry and they're going to change things so this doesn't happen again. That's all I really wanted.' Siefkin's experience was far from the worst that the men and women who served our country have endured in recent years. Thousands of complaints have been filed against the VA, and in many cases, veterans have died while waiting to receive treatment or have been killed due to malpractice on the part of VA doctors and staff. This case is just a clear illustration of how absurd and wrong-headed VA policies and practices can be. This incident begs the question: how can President Obama justify busing illegal aliens thousands of miles to drop them off in U.S. cities, when a VA hospital can't even wheel an injured vet 10 feet to receive medical care? After all, both are the responsibility of the Executive Branch. Sources: http://www.seattletimes.com \n",
      " Tweet (NewsTarget) The bird flu has struck South Korea after three years of little to no activity. The H5N1 virus is a highly virulent strain that could potentially spread to and kill humans. South Korea's Agriculture Ministry said earlier this week it suspected bird flu had killed 6,000 chickens at a farm in the southwest of the country that lies on a path for migratory birds. A Ministry official said 'It is the H5N1 strain' after seeing test results from the suspected case. After the results were reported, the Agriculture Ministry ordered the culling of 236,000 poultry within a 1,640-foot radius of the farm in South Korea's North Cholla province, which is located about 100 miles from Seoul. In addition, quarantine authorities also banned the shipment of more than 5 million poultry from 221 farms within a 6.2-mile radius of the farm. No signs of human infection had been spotted or reported among local residents or quarantine officials, according to another Agriculture Ministry official. Between December 2003 and March 2004 -- about 400,000 poultry at South Korean farms were infected by bird flu. That recent history has caused concern on this latest case, because during the outbreak from 2003, South Korea culled 5.3 million birds -- and spent about $1.6 billion on preventing the disease from spreading. After the 2003 South Korean outbreak, tests in the U.S. indicated that at least nine South Korean workers involved in the cull had been infected with the H5N1 virus. However, none of the infected workers developed major illnesses. Since 2003, outbreaks have been confirmed in around 50 countries and territories around the globe. The World Health Organization said that by Nov. 13 of this year, there had been 258 cases of human infection of the H5N1 strain since 2003, resulting in 153 deaths. Many of the H5N1 victims were in Asia, with 98 deaths in Vietnam and Indonesia. ### \n",
      " A recent survey of hospitals found that infections, surgical errors and other medical harm contribute to the deaths of about 180,000 patients a year. The projections by Consumer Reports magazine were based on a 2010 report by the Department of Health and Human Resources. In addition to the deaths, the government report found that another 1.4 million patients are seriously hurt by their hospital care. What is most interesting about these results is that they cover just a small sample; the figures pertain only to Medicare patients. What happens to other patients is less clear, the magazine said, because most hospital errors don't get reported and hospitals only report a small fraction of what can go wrong. 'There is an epidemic of health-care harm,' Rosemary Gibson, a patient-safety advocate and author, said. 'Hospitals haven't given safety the attention it deserves' She adds that somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.25 million Americans will probably die from medical harm this decade. 'That's like wiping out the entire populations of North Dakota, Rhode Island and Vermont. It's a man-made disaster,' she said. Some hospitals are responding to this crisis by implementing new safety measures such as electronically prescribing medications to help prevent drug errors and checklists to prevent infections - with some success. Since 2008, rates of central-line bloodstream infections, for instance, have fallen off by 32 percent, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . That's a start, but much more needs to be done, industry experts say. 'Hospitals haven't given safety the attention it deserves,' notes Peter Pronovost, M.D., senior VP for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. The government hasn't made it a priority either, he added. 'Medical harm is probably one of the three leading causes of death in the U.S., but the government doesn't adequately track it as it does deaths from automobiles, plane crashes, and cancer. It's appalling,' he told the magazine. The dearth of information, he says, not only makes it harder to identify and define the extent of the problem but also creates challenges for patients who are trying to learn more about the safety of hospitals in their communities. That's where Consumer Reports stepped up. For the first time, in August 2012, the magazine rated hospitals for safety, utilizing the most current data available. The analysis includes data from both government and independent sources on 1,159 hospitals in 44 states. For their report, the magazine said it 'also interviewed patients, physicians, hospital administrators, and safety experts; reviewed medical literature; and looked at hospital inspections and investigations.' That said, the ratings still only include 18 percent of U.S. hospitals because data on patient harm is still not fully reported or available consistently nationwide. 'Hospitals that volunteer safety information, regardless of their score, deserve credit, since the first step in safety is accountability,' John Santa, M.D., director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center , said. 'But the fact that consumers can't get a full picture of most hospitals in the U.S. underscores the need for more public reporting.' All hospitals have something bad about them To make its determinations, the magazine focused on six things: infections, readmissions, communication, CT scanning, complications, and mortality. Not all health professionals agreed with the ratings scheme. Readmission rates, for instance, could be higher among hospitals care for patients who then have little home or community support after being discharged. Some of the most important findings include: -- There are bad things that happen in all hospitals. But the difference is, in terms of ratings, bad things happen in some hospitals more often than others. Consumer Reports said: 'The lowest--scoring hospital, Sacred Heart Hospital in Chicago, earned just a 16 on our 100-point safety scale and reported a rate of bloodstream -infections that was more than twice the national benchmark. The hospital declined to comment.' -- Even hospitals with high ratings/scores can do better. The Billings Clinic in Montana was at the top of the magazine's safety ratings list, but it only got a 72 (out of a possible 100). -- Some well-known hospitals have less-than-stellar safety scores (including Massachusetts General in Boston and Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles). The American Association of Justice - formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of America - says preventable medical errors are the sixth-biggest killer in the country.

      " Historically, the local county sheriff has been considered to be the highest authority in the land, wielding more power than city, state and even federal authorities. In Delaware; however, that power is under attack, according to one of the state's three county authorities. Sheriff Jeffrey Christopher says when he was elected to office in 2010, he believed he was supposed to represent his constituents as the highest-ranking law enforcement authority in the county. Instead, he has landed smack dab in the middle of a battle for the future of an American law enforcement precedent dating back to the founding of the nation, the American Free Press reported. 'It is one more example of federal and state governments ignoring the will of the people as well state laws. In the case of Delaware, the state's own constitution stipulates that the office of the sheriff is a constitutionally created position just like the secretary of state and the attorney general,' the web publication reported. 'Delaware's Constitution states: 'The sheriffs shall be conservators of the peace within the counties . . . in which they reside.'' 'The others won't stand up with me' The Delaware initiative is being headed by state Attorney General Beau Biden, who is, perhaps not so ironically, the son of Vice President Joe Biden. The report said Biden's office has sent out mandates to county commissioners informing them their sheriffs no longer have powers of arrest. Moreover, AFP said, the position of Biden's office has been seconded by State Solicitor L.W. Lewis, who said in an opinion released a year ago that neither state nor common law grants arrest powers to local county sheriffs . In reality; however, the office of the sheriff was created in the American colonies well before the nation's official founding. In fact, AFP said, Delaware's first sheriff held office in 1669. In a January 2012 interview, Christopher told AFP that the two prior sheriff administrations, dating back as far as 2000, both noticed reductions in funding and the erosion of their offices in general. 'Now my deputies and I have been relieved of all arrest powers and can't even make a traffic stop,' he said. ' Delaware has only three counties. . . The other two sheriffs...will not stand up with me' to prevent the elimination of county law enforcement, Christopher added. The sheriff said the lack of authority vested in his office really came to light during an incident involving a county councilman, Vance Phillips. Christopher said he was struck in the eye and kicked by the councilman but could not arrest him. Bumping off another uniquely American precedent 'I want to recreate the office in the way it was intended,' Christopher, a Republican, told The Huffington Post . 'A sheriff is supposed to be out there responding to the wishes of the people, just as the police do. Most people want to see more of a presence of law enforcement.' Delaware sheriffs traditionally conduct foreclosure sales and deliver court papers, local TV affiliate WBOC reported. While Christopher says his bid to increase the power of his office is rooted in the state's constitution, opponents say he is misinterpreting the phrase. Nevertheless, HuffPo said Christopher has allowed his deputies to chase down felons and other criminals. 'He continues to say he's law enforcement, and he's not,' says state House Majority Leader Pete Schwartzkopf, a Democrat, who introduced a bill last year specifically denying sheriffs the ability to arrest suspects and investigate crimes. 'It's not a good position to be in, to have no authority over a person who carries a gun. It's scary.' Actually, what's truly 'scary' is that yet another uniquely American precedent is being steamrollered by statist politicians who have empowered themselves to do so.

      " Emerging research into a rare kind of fat cell known as brown fat may lead to new medical interventions to fight obesity. Researchers have known for some time of the existence of brown fat in newborn mammals. Unlike the more common white fat, which stores energy, brown fat actually releases energy in order to help heat the body. With the recent discovery that some brown fat cells also exist in adult humans, researchers have begun to wonder whether it might be used to help obese people lose weight. In two studies recently published in the journal Nature , researchers explored the bodily mechanisms that regulate brown fat. In the first, a team of researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston built on its previous finding that a specific gene transcription factor known as PRDM16 helps regulate the activity of brown fat cells. When the researchers removed that transcription factor from immature brown fat cells, the cells immediately turned into muscle. 'What we show in this paper is kind of a big shock,' researcher Bruce Spiegelman said. 'We show that brown fat is derived from a muscle-like cell, and that brown fat and white fat are completely different.' Previously, the same team showed that the addition of PRDM16 could cause white fat cells to turn into brown fat. They are now investigating whether a pharmaceutical drug could be used to stimulate the activity of PRDM16 and encourage the body to make more brown fat. In a second study, researchers from the Joslin Diabetes Center, also in Boston, injected a bone growth protein called BMP-7 into the bodies of mice by means of a virus. The mice that had been injected with BMP-7 subsequently developed more brown fat cells and gained less weight than mice that had not been injected. The same result occurred when researchers transplanted BMP-7-treated immature brown fat cells into adult mice. Sources for this story include: www.reuters.com . \n",
      " No matter how many times we say, 'I'll never do that again!' when we imbibe in alcohol a little too much, for many there is, sadly, a next time. And a next. And each time, people seem to want to try new and better ways to ease the pain of the inevitable hangover -- techniques that are rooted in legend, old wives' tales and the words of the barroom physician. By the way, the peak of so-called morning after pain occurs at 29 years old, says a recent study from Denmark. Well, to date, there is no 'cure' for the common hangover, though there are some 'treatments,' so to speak. Among them, according to About.com : -- Sleep -- Liquids (because you're dehydrated) like vegetable and fruit drinks coupled with water -- Vitamin C (try some organic orange juice) -- Eat, even if you don't feel like it; mineral- and protein-rich foods are best Now, on to those 'cures' that don't work, as compiled by Men's Health magazine: 'Hair of the dog that bit you' : A morning-after shot of whiskey or Bloody Mary? Well, that may numb your pain, but it's temporary, according to Gary Murray, acting director of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) Division of Metabolism and Health Effects. Taking another drink (or a few more drinks) will only delay the wearing-off effect of your bender. Rehydrating is crucial; alcohol will further dehydrate. Have a greasy breakfast : Think loading up on sausage, eggs and hash browns will help absorb whatever alcohol is left? Nope, because there is no alcohol left by the time you wake up. And in truth, greasy, non-organic, processed food -- besides being incredibly bad for your body -- is likely to accomplish only one thing: giving you heartburn. But again, as stated above, certain foods are better than others. The old standby, coffee : 'There is a cognitive impairment that results from a hangover--a brain fog, which impairs your ability to perform,' Murray says. And while a tad bit of coffee might make you a bit more alert because of the caffeine, coffee is also a major diuretic and, again, you're already badly dehydrated from too much alcohol consumption . Water is better. Have a late-night meal before turning in (wasted) : The theory here is, again, a late-night meal will help absorb the alcohol in your system and therefore ease the pain of getting up in the morning. But in truth, says Murray, 'Eating after you've already been drinking isn't going to help absorb or metabolize the alcohol.' Actually, the trick is to eat a solid meal before you're too many drinks into your evening, because food helps slow the rate at which your body absorbs alcohol, thereby releasing it into your bloodstream at a slower, and far better, rate. Just lie around in bed all day : That isn't effective. Murray told Men's Health , 'studies have shown that the intoxicated go to bed roughly 2 hours later than sober people on the same night.' So, 'fatigue, headache, irritability--these are all symptoms of a hangover , but also of sleep deprivation.' The better option is to grab a couple of more hours of sleep and experience another REM cycle that you likely missed the night before. After that, get up, get around and about and wake yourself up, and Murray says you'll feel much better. Just sweat it out with exercise : Um, you can't really 'sweat it out,' because the culprit -- alcohol -- has already left your system. Still, increasing your basal metabolic rate, or BMR, which is what naturally happens when you exercise, can maybe increase your changes of getting rid of the toxic byproducts. Just pop a couple of painkillers before bed : Not effective. Not only are compounds like aspirin and over-the-counter pain killers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) hazardous in and of themselves and mixed with alcohol, but they can be dangerous even after your body has metabolized the alcohol (which takes about an hour). 'Alcohol turns on specific enzymes in your body that stay present long after you're no longer impaired, even into the next day,' Murray explains. These enzymes can interact dangerously with acetaminophens. The best 'cure'? Avoid over-indulgence in the first place, or, if you didn't, try a natural cure: http://www.selfnews.com .

      " A ranking Food and Drug Administration official is facing four counts of soliciting prostitution and a single count of disorderly conduct stemming from his arrest by Howard County, Md., Police last month. Dr. William Maisel, the deputy director for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health , was nabbed July 13 during an undercover sting operation along a busy corridor in Laurel, reports said. Maisel was one of ten suspected arrested in the operation. In a statement, the agency declined to speculate or comment, saying only, 'This is a personal matter and unrelated to the work of the FDA or Dr. Maisel's work at the agency,' according to spokeswoman Erica Jefferson. 'Dr. Maisel is still employed by the agency and is working.' His mug shot is available here . Maisel, who joined the FDA in 2010, is scheduled for a preliminary court hearing Sept. 20. A smart guy - Just a bad choice Prior to the FDA, Maisel, 46, held prominent positions at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and taught at Harvard Medical School , said reports. According to the website Vitals.com , which profiles physicians, Maisel is a Board-certified cardiologist who attended Cornell Medical College . A separate website belonging to the Medical Device Manufacturer's Association listed additional biographical information: William H. Maisel, MD, MPH is Chief Scientist and Deputy Center Director for Science at FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). He is responsible for providing leadership in the development, implementation, execution, management and direction of the Center's broad national and international biomedical science programs. He is also a former chair of the FDA Circulatory System and Post-Market Medical Device Advisory Committees, and is a former member of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Coverage Advisory Committee. Beside his medical degree, he also has a an undergraduate degree in biology from MIT , and a master's in Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health . 'Maisel joined the agency as its first deputy director for science in 2010, but his interactions with the agency date back to 2003 when he advised the Center for Devices and Radiological Health as a consultant,' said a report in MedCity News . Extensive history and experience Among Maisel's cardiology specialties is arrhythmia - irregular, improper heart rhythms that can cause circulatory problems and even death. Reports suggest Maisel applied his cardiology specialties to the medical devices industry. In 2005, for example, he conducted a study for the FDA that found 20 out of every 1,000 implanted heart defibrillators were malfunctioning, failures which led to some 31 deaths between 1990 and 2002, USA Today reported. The study found there were 2.25 million pacemakers and almost 416,000 implanted cardiac defibrillators, or ICDs, implanted in the United States, the paper said. Of those, 17,000 of them - 8,834 pacemakers and 8,489 ICDs - had to be removed because of malfunctions. In an editorial this year, he touted the agency's role in approving new medical devices. 'Each year, millions of American patients benefit from innovative medical devices that reduce suffering, treat previously untreatable conditions, extend lives, and improve public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is committed to assuring that patients have timely access to important new technologies and next-generation medical devices without compromising safety,' he wrote. It wasn't clear whether the FDA would retain Maisel at publication time, nor if he planned to plead guilty in court.

      " There is yet another thing that your government didn't tell you about Obamacare and its subsequent expansion of Medicaid: If you enroll in the taxpayer-funded health coverage program through an Obamacare exchange, then, when you die, your estate will be taken by the government. As reported by the Seattle Times : It wasn't the moonlight, holiday-season euphoria or family pressure that made Sofia Prins and Gary Balhorn, both 62, suddenly decide to get married. It was the fine print. As fine print is wont to do, it had buried itself in a long form - Balhorn's application for free health insurance through the expanded state Medicaid program. As the paperwork lay on the dining-room table in Port Townsend, Prins began reading. She was shocked: If you're 55 or over, Medicaid can come back after you're dead and bill your estate for ordinary health-care expenses. Penalizing the poor in the end Suddenly, the Prins no longer saw that obtaining their health insurance through Medicaid was going to be 'free.' Rather, it's more of a loan - one whose requirements to pay back premiums isn't very well advertised. Not only that, the requirement is punitive, as most government mandates are: It penalizes folks who, though they may be poor, have managed to keep a house or accrue some savings they hoped to pass along to heirs. In reality, Medicaid - in compliance with federal policy - has long recouped payouts via estates. But, because the majority of low-income Americans without disabilities couldn't otherwise qualify for typical medical coverage under Medicaid , 'recovery primarily involved expenses for nursing homes and long-term care,' the Times said. Obamacare changed all of that by expanding Medicaid coverage to many more Americans. In Washington state, lawmakers are hearing from distraught and angry constituents as they learn about the great government Medicaid recovery plan that no one told them about. In response, lawmakers are looking at what they can do to repair the clash of state rules with the Affordable Care Act: [Recently] , Gov. Jay Inslee's office and the state Medicaid office said they plan to draft an emergency rule to limit estate recovery to long-term care and related medical expenses. They hope to be able to change the rules before coverage begins Jan. 1. Fixing the problem will cost the state about $3 million a year, said Dr. Bob Crittenden, Inslee's senior health-policy adviser, but it's the right thing to do. 'There was no intent on the part of the ACA to do estate recovery on people going into Medicaid (for health insurance),' Crittenden said. 'The idea was to expand coverage.' 'People will think this is free' The Times said residents in their 50s and 60s currently make up about 30 percent of adults who have signed up through the state's Obamacare exchange. Some residents 55-60 years old who have either taken early retirements or who became unemployed due to the recent recession have now found themselves in a low-income bracket. In the past, in order to qualify for Medicaid, applicants were required to reduce their assets; with the Obamacare expansion, however, now more recipients are better off and more likely to have homes and other assets. Writing in The Washington Times , Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the politically conservative Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, labeled the recovery provision 'a cash cow for states to milk the poor and the middle class.' 'People will think this is wonderful, this is free insurance,' Orient said in an interview. 'They don't realize it's really a loan, and is secured by any property they have.' She went on to warn that even states that move to limit estate recovery can eventually change the rules again if they begin to have budget shortfalls.

      " A newly issued report by a U.S. senator found that more than 1,000 U.S. veterans likely died in the past decade because of malpractice in regard to a lack of proper and timely care from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical centers. The report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., himself a physician, 'aggregates government investigations and media reports to trace a history of fraudulent scheduling practices, budget mismanagement, insufficient oversight and lack of accountability that have led to the current controversy plaguing the VA,' CNN reported. CNN was the first to break the story that some U.S. military veterans had died after being placed on a 'secret waiting list' at the VA medical center in Phoenix. Poor management is costing billions The VA has since admitted that 23 patients died awaiting care that was delayed months, but Coburn's report titled 'Friendly Fire: Death, Delay and Dismay at the VA' reveals that many more deaths have been linked to system-wide failures at VA hospitals and clinics all over the country. Coburn stated that if the VA's budget had been handled properly and the correct management put in place, many of those deaths could have been avoided. 'Over the past decade, more than 1,000 veterans may have died as a result of VA malfeasance,' Coburn, who has survived three bouts with cancer, said. He believes the government should offer veterans access to private-sector hospitals and clinics. 'Poor management is costing the department billions of dollars more and compromising veterans' access to medical care,' he said. Malpractice suits, office remodeling, bonuses Coburn's office said that the VA has allocated some $20 billion since the beginning of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to a number of non-health-related projects, such as office remodels, unused software licenses, undocumented government debit card purchases, the funding of call centers that received just 2.4 calls per day on average and bonuses for top officials, including administrators of the facilities where vets died waiting for care. As CNN reported: 'In 2013, four VA construction projects in Las Vegas, Orlando, Denver and New Orleans cost an extra $1.5 billion because of scheduling delays and excessive expenditures, the report shows. 'Additional funds have been funneled into legal settlements. Since 2001, the VA has paid about $845 million in malpractice costs, of which $36.4 million was used to settle claims involving delayed health care.' Additional scrutiny has been applied to the VA's budget following revelations about the controversial bonus system payments; they allegedly created incentives for administrators and managers to hide the fact that patients had to wait months for care. At a recent congressional hearing, VA Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration Gina Farrisee confirmed that 78% of senior VA managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013 (fiscal years run from Oct. 1 - Sept. 30), despite the malpractice and treatment delay controversies. Here's one of the more egregious examples: 'Former VA Regional Director Michael Moreland received a $63,000 bonus in 2013 for infection prevention policies, for example, but the VA's Office of Inspector General concluded that his policies failed. Moreland presided over the Pittsburgh VA, where an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease killed six veterans in 2011 and 2012.' In addition, Coburn's report identified crimes that had been committed by VA staff, such as drug dealing, theft and sexual abuse of patients. The incidents spanned the past several years. The requirements are so low Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said in a news conference in Washington in mid-June that he will be removing more VA officials from their positions after he receives more information from the VA Inspector General's Office. However, it's clear the VA's problems are much more systemic and, honestly, successive congresses and White House administrations share the blame. The VA system is like all government-run systems and agencies : There have always been too few resources allocated for the function the agency was created to perform; the incentive to cheat is strong (bonuses in amounts that surpass what 85% of Americans earn in a year); too little real oversight; and an institutionalized bureaucracy that is more concerned about self-preservation than anything else. Some names and positions might change, but the real answer -- getting government out of the healthcare business altogether -- won't. Coburn -- who said he wasn't surprised by his report -- knows; he was trained in a VA hospital. 'The culture in the VA should be people working for veterans, not for the VA, [but] the culture right now is that I work for a system ... and the requirements are so low,' he told Politico . \n",
      " Do you remember our recent story ( http://www.selfnews.com ) about Coca-Cola getting away with advertising one of its drinks as 'Pomegranate Blueberry,' even though it only contained a measly 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, of each of those juices? Well, we now learn that the federal government not only sanctions lying about ingredients in drinks, but will punish companies who try to tell the truth about those same products. To recap: Beverage company Pom Wonderful which, as its name suggests, manufactures drinks containing lots of pomegranate, lost a federal false advertising suit it launched against Coca-Cola's subsidiary, Minute Maid, which manufactures the aforementioned Pomegranate Blueberry, because while the ingredients are prominently displayed on the labeling, there is very little of them actually in the drink. But a federal appeals panel, citing federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules, disagreed with Pom Wonderful. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that said federal regulations say a company can name a drink after a 'flavoring' that it contains, even if it's not the primary ingredient. What makes the ruling even more incredulous, given the second part of this story, is the fact that Minute Maid's label on Pomegranate Blueberry says, 'Help Nourish Your Brain' above a drawing of fruits. That, as you may have deduced, suggests a medical benefit from drinking this pomegranate concoction, even if there isn't much actual pomegranate in it. What's 'deceptive' about the truth? Enter Pom Wonderful, the company that actually puts pomegranate - which research proves can lower harmful LDL cholesterol levels, improve blood flow to the heart for cardiac patients, reduce thickening of arteries that supply blood to the brain, and lower blood pressure - in its drinks. It seems the same federal court system thinks it's okay for Coca-Cola to sprinkle a little of the juice in its drinks and call it nourishment for your brain , but Pom Wonderful - whose drinks contain 100 percent pomegranate juice - can't tout the fruit's health benefits. Just days after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals shot down Pom's lawsuit against Coca-Cola, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) judge ruled that health claims made by Pom were deceptive. The ruling from Administrate Law Judge D. Michael Chappell came after hearing testimony for months, from May through November 2011 - testimony which included appearances by noted diet and coronary expert Dr. Dean Ornish, who - among other foods - recommends eating pomegranates to improve cardiac health. Note, too, that Pom Wonderful, a Delaware company which is headquartered in Los Angeles, has spent some $35 million over the past 10 years studying the health benefits of pomegranates, and relied on the results of that body of research in advertising its products. Not officially sanctioned research Chappell, however, said Pom's advertising 'would lead reasonable consumers to conclude that drinking Pom's juice or taking its supplements would treat, prevent, or reduce serious health problems, and that it was clinically proven to do so,' according to Courthouse News Service . What's more, Chappell said in his 330-page ruling that while Pom's research indeed showed a general health benefit in consuming pomegranate, 'the weight of the persuasive expert testimony demonstrates that there was insufficient competent and reliable scientific evidence to support' the company's specific claims. Huh? Well, all of this is much easier to understand if you look at it from this perspective. It's all about the Leviathan telling you what is, and is not, 'healthy,' and what you can, and cannot say, about legitimate research if it is not conducted or sanctioned by the high-and-mighty in D.C. Pom Wonderful spent tens of millions on research that proves consuming its pomegranate beverages improves overall health. But because the federal government didn't make this discovery, then it's not legitimate and, therefore, inadmissible. Now do these conflicting rulings make sense? For the record, pomegranate is quickly gaining favor in health circles for its nutritional value as an antioxidant-rich fruit. It's health benefits are well-documented now, even if you don't read about them in some government agency's literature. You might say a company that does its own research is tainting the results, but on the other hand, if the same company is later found to have falsified data, what implications would that discovery have for a business that wants to stay around for the long haul? \n"
